### **Manual Scheduled QA Process:** Deployment and QA are handled through a manually scheduled process, lacking automation and continuous integration.

### **Basic Automation with Infrequent Deployments:** Some level of automation exists in the QA process, but deployments are infrequent and partially manual.

### **Integrated Deployment and Regular QA Checks:** Deployment is integrated with regular QA checks, featuring a moderate level of automation and consistency in the pipeline.

### **CI/CD with Automated Testing:** A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is in place, including automated testing and frequent, reliable deployments.

### **On-Demand Ephemeral Environments:** Deployment and QA utilize short-lived, ephemeral environments provisioned on demand, indicating a highly sophisticated, efficient, and agile pipeline.
