### **No Routine Measurements, Slow Processes:** There are no routine measurements for build and deployment times. Builds and deployments often take days to plan and hours to execute, with little monitoring for SLA compliance.

### **Basic Tracking with Some Delays:** Some basic tracking of build and deployment times is in place, but processes are still relatively slow, often resulting in delays.

### **Moderate Efficiency with Occasional Monitoring:** The organization has moderately efficient build and deployment processes, with occasional monitoring and efforts to adhere to timelines.

### **Streamlined Processes with Regular Monitoring:** Builds and deployments are streamlined and regularly monitored, ensuring that they are completed within reasonable timeframes.

### **Continual Improvement with Rapid Execution:** The organization has a strong focus on continual improvement and efficiency. 99% of builds and deployments are completed in single-digit minutes, with consistent monitoring and optimization efforts.
