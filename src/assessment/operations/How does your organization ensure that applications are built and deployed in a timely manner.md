### **No Routine Measurements, Slow Processes:** There are no routine measurements for build and deployment times. Builds and deployments often take days to plan and hours to execute, with little monitoring for SLA compliance.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this level, your organization may treat builds and deployments as irregular events with minimal oversight. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Very Low Release Frequency**

   - You only release occasionally (e.g., once every few months), so tracking speed or efficiency seems less critical.
   - Slow deployment cycles are acceptable due to stable requirements or minimal user impact.

1. **Limited Pressure from Stakeholders**

   - Internal or external stakeholders do not demand quick rollouts or frequent features, so extended lead times go unchallenged.

1. **No Critical Deadlines**
   - Lacking strict compliance or operational SLA obligations, you might not prioritize faster release cadences.

However, as soon as your environment grows, user demands increase, or compliance regulations require more frequent updates (e.g., security patches), slow processes can create risk and bottlenecks.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** steps to introduce basic measurements and reduce build/deployment durations:

1. **Implement a Simple Tracking Mechanism**

   - Start by documenting each deployment’s start and end times in a spreadsheet or ticket system:
     - Track which environment was deployed, total time taken, any blockers encountered.
   - Over a few weeks, you’ll get a baseline for improvement.

1. **Automate Basic Steps**

   - If you’re manually building code, add a script or minimal pipeline:
     - [AWS CodeBuild or a simple Jenkins job to compile and package the application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/jenkins-plugin.html)
     - [Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitHub Actions for automated builds of .NET/Java/Node.js apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-pipelines&tabs=yaml)
     - [GCP Cloud Build to package containers or run test scripts automatically](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/create-basic-configuration)
     - [OCI DevOps build pipelines for straightforward build tasks in Oracle Cloud environments](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DevOps/Concepts/overview.htm)

1. **Adopt a Central Version Control System**

   - If you aren’t already, store source code and deployment artifacts in Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos, etc.):
   - This lays the groundwork for more advanced automation later.

1. **Introduce Basic SLAs for Deployment Windows**

   - e.g., "We aim to complete production deployments within 1 working day once approved."
   - This ensures staff start to see time-to-deploy as a priority.

1. **Identify Key Bottlenecks**
   - Are approvals causing delays? Are you waiting for a single SME to do manual steps?
   - Focus on automating or streamlining the top pain point first.

By tracking deployments in a simple manner, automating the most time-consuming tasks, and setting minimal SLAs, you begin reducing deployment time and gain insight into where further improvements can be made.

### **Basic Tracking with Some Delays:** Some basic tracking of build and deployment times is in place, but processes are still relatively slow, often resulting in delays.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this level, you record how long builds and deployments take, but you still experience extended lead times. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Moderately Frequent Releases**

   - You release a new version monthly or quarterly, and while not fast, it meets your current expectations.

1. **Limited Pressure from Users**

   - Stakeholders occasionally push for quicker releases, but the demand remains manageable.
   - You deliver essential updates without major user complaints.

1. **Some Awareness of Bottlenecks**
   - You know where delays occur (e.g., environment setup, manual test cycles), but you haven’t tackled them systematically.

If your team can tolerate these delays and no critical issues arise, you might remain here temporarily. However, you risk frustrating users or missing security patches if you can’t accelerate when needed.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to reduce delays and evolve your tracking:

1. **Automate Testing**

   - Expand beyond a simple build script, adding automated tests (unit, integration):
     - [AWS CodeBuild or AWS CodePipeline with unit test steps using tools like JUnit, NUnit, or PyTest](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/test-reports-with-aws-codebuild/)
     - [Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitHub Actions to run your chosen language’s test frameworks automatically](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-pipelines&tabs=yaml)
     - [GCP Cloud Build with integrated testing steps or Tekton-based pipelines for containerized workflows](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/create-basic-configuration)
     - [OCI DevOps pipeline steps for automated testing before artifact promotion](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DevOps/Concepts/overview.htm)

1. **Streamline Approvals**

   - If manager sign-off is causing long waits, propose a structured yet efficient approval flow:
     - For example, define a Slack or Teams channel where changes can be quickly acknowledged.
     - Use a ticket system or pipeline-based manual approval steps that require minimal overhead.

1. **Implement Parallel or Incremental Deployments**

   - Instead of a big-bang approach, deploy smaller changes more frequently:
     - If teams see fewer changes in each release, testing and validation can be quicker.

1. **Enforce Clear Deployment Windows**

   - e.g., "Production deploys occur every Tuesday and Thursday at 2 PM," with a cut-off for code submissions.
   - This planning reduces ad hoc deployments that cause confusion.

1. **Set Target Timelines**
   - e.g., "Builds should not exceed 30 minutes from commit to artifact," or "Deployments to test environments should complete within an hour of code merges."
   - Start small, measure progress, and refine goals.

By adding automated testing, simplifying approvals, and promoting incremental deployments, you shorten delays and create a more responsive release pipeline.

### **Moderate Efficiency with Occasional Monitoring:** The organization has moderately efficient build and deployment processes, with occasional monitoring and efforts to adhere to timelines.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

If you see mostly consistent build and deploy times—often measured in hours or under a day—and have some checks to ensure timely releases, you might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Regular Release Cadence**

   - You release weekly or bi-weekly, and while it’s not fully streamlined, you meet user expectations.

1. **Intermediate Automation**

   - CI/CD pipelines handle building, testing, and packaging fairly reliably, with occasional manual steps.

1. **Some Monitoring of SLAs**

   - You measure deployment times for important services. If they exceed certain thresholds, you investigate.

1. **Sporadic Improvement Initiatives**
   - You occasionally gather feedback from dev teams or ops to tweak the pipeline, but you don’t have a continuous improvement loop.

If this approach satisfies your current workloads and stakeholder demands, you may feel it’s sufficient. However, you could still improve deployment speed, reduce manual overhead, and achieve faster feedback cycles.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to enhance your moderate efficiency:

1. **Add Real-Time or Automated Monitoring**

   - Implement dashboards or Slack/Teams notifications for every build/deployment, capturing:
     - Duration, pass/fail status, and any QA feedback.
     - Tools:
       - [AWS: Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CodeBuild/CodePipeline notifications, or a custom Slack integration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/receive-aws-developer-tools-notifications-over-slack-using-aws-chatbot/)
       - [Azure DevOps Dashboards, or GitHub Actions with webhooks for real-time alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/integrations/slack?view=azure-devops)
       - [GCP: Cloud Logging or Pub/Sub-based triggers that notify on certain pipeline events](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/agent/installation)
       - [OCI DevOps pipeline notifications, integrated with email or Slack-like channels](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DevOps/Concepts/overview.htm)

1. **Optimize Build and Test Steps**

   - Identify any overly long test suites or build tasks:
     - e.g., parallelize tests or use caching to skip redundant steps.
   - Tools like [AWS CodeBuild caching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-caching.html), [Azure Pipeline caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/caching?view=azure-devops), or [GCP Cloud Build caching](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/build-caching) can accelerate repeat builds.

1. **Adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

   - If you manage infrastructure changes manually, incorporate IaC to reduce environment setup delays:
     - [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/index.html), [Azure Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/), [GCP Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager), or [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for multi-cloud solutions.
   - This ensures consistent provisioning for test and production environments.

1. **Implement Rolling or Blue/Green Deployments**

   - Reduce downtime and user impact by applying advanced deployment strategies.
   - The more confident you are in your pipeline, the faster you can roll out changes.

1. **Introduce Regular Retrospectives**
   - e.g., monthly or bi-weekly sessions to review deployment metrics (average build time, deployment durations).
   - Plan small improvements each cycle—like removing a manual test step or simplifying a build script.

By improving monitoring, optimizing test/build steps, adopting IaC, and refining deployment strategies, you make your moderately efficient process even faster and more stable.

### **Streamlined Processes with Regular Monitoring:** Builds and deployments are streamlined and regularly monitored, ensuring that they are completed within reasonable timeframes.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this level, your builds and deployments are typically quick (tens of minutes or fewer) and monitored in near real time. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Predictable Release Cycles**

   - You release multiple times a week (or more frequently) with minimal disruptions or user complaints.
   - Stakeholders trust the release process.

1. **CI/CD Tools Are Widely Adopted**

   - Dev and ops teams rely on a mostly automated pipeline for build, test, and deploy steps.
   - Manual intervention is needed only for critical approvals or exception handling.

1. **Proactive Monitoring**

   - You gather metrics on build times, test coverage, deployment frequency, and quickly spot regressions.
   - Reports or dashboards are regularly reviewed by leadership.

1. **Collaboration on Improvement**
   - Teams occasionally refine the pipeline or test processes, though not always in a continuous improvement cycle.

If your organization can reliably deliver updates swiftly, you’ve likely avoided major inefficiencies. Yet there is usually room to refine further, aiming for near real-time feedback and single-digit-minute pipelines.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to optimize an already streamlined process:

1. **Expand Shift-Left Testing and Security**

   - Integrate early security scanning, code quality checks, and performance tests into your pipeline:
     - [AWS CodeGuru or Amazon Inspector hooking into CodePipeline to detect issues pre-deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/security-ug/get-started-codepipeline.html)
     - [Azure DevOps or GitHub Advanced Security scanning code for vulnerabilities in each pull request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/security/github-advanced-security-code-scanning?view=azure-devops)
     - [GCP Cloud Build with embedded SAST or container vulnerability scanning before rolling out](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/create-basic-configuration)
     - [OCI DevOps pipeline steps for vulnerability scanning or compliance checks on container images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DevOps/Concepts/overview.htm)

2. **Add Automated Rollback or Canary Analysis**

   - If a new release fails performance or user acceptance checks, revert automatically:
     - e.g., using canary deployments with [AWS AppConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html) or [Azure App Service Deployment Slots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/deployment-slots) or [GCP Cloud Run revisions](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying/revisions)

3. **Adopt Feature Flags**

   - Further speed up deployment by decoupling feature rollout from the actual code release:
     - This allows partial or user-segmented rollouts, improving feedback loops.

4. **Implement Detailed Pipeline Telemetry**

   - If you only track overall build/deploy times, gather finer metrics:
     - Time spent in unit tests vs. integration tests, container image builds vs. scanning, environment creation vs. final validations.
   - These insights highlight your next optimization targets.

5. **Formalize Continuous Improvement**
   - Host regular pipeline reviews or "build engineering" sprints.
   - Evaluate changes in build times, error rates, or frequency of hotfixes. Use these insights to plan enhancements.

By infusing advanced scanning, canary release strategies, feature flags, and deeper telemetry into your existing streamlined pipeline, you further reduce risk, speed up feedback, and maintain a high level of operational maturity.

### **Continual Improvement with Rapid Execution:** The organization has a strong focus on continual improvement and efficiency. 99% of builds and deployments are completed in single-digit minutes, with consistent monitoring and optimization efforts.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this final stage, your builds and deployments are lightning-fast, happening in minutes for most projects. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Highly Automated, Highly Reliable**

   - DevOps and security teams trust the pipeline to handle frequent releases with minimal downtime or errors.
   - Manual approval steps exist only for the most sensitive changes, and they’re quick.

1. **Real-Time Monitoring and Feedback**

   - You track pipeline performance metrics, code quality checks, and security scans in real time, swiftly adjusting if numbers dip below thresholds.

1. **Continuous Innovation**

   - The pipeline is never considered "finished"; you constantly adopt new tools or practices that further reduce overhead or increase confidence.

1. **Robust Disaster Recovery**
   - Rapid pipeline execution means quick redeploys in case of failure or environment replication.
   - With single-digit-minute pipelines, rollback or rebuild times are also minimized.

Though exemplary, there’s always an opportunity to embed more advanced practices (e.g., AI/ML for anomaly detection in release metrics) and to collaborate with other public sector entities to share your high-speed processes.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to refine a near-optimal pipeline:

1. **Incorporate AI/ML Insights**

   - Tools or custom scripts that analyze build logs and deployment results for anomalies or patterns over time:
     - e.g., predicting which code changes may cause test failures, optimizing pipeline concurrency.

1. **Expand Multi-Stage Testing and Observability**

   - Integrate performance, load, and chaos testing into your pipeline:
     - [AWS Fault Injection Simulator](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/) or [Azure Chaos Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/chaos-studio/) for resilience tests automatically triggered in your pipeline after staging deploys
     - [GCP can use chaos engineering frameworks in Cloud Build triggers, or custom steps for load tests in staging environments](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/create-basic-configuration)
     - [OCI can incorporate chaos testing scripts in DevOps pipelines for reliability checks pre-production](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DevOps/Concepts/overview.htm)

1. **Share Expertise Across Agencies**

   - If your pipeline is among the fastest in the UK public sector, participate in cross-government knowledge-sharing:
     - Offer case studies or presentations at GDS or GovTech events, or collaborate with other agencies for mutual learning.

1. **Fully Integrate Infrastructure and Policy as Code**

   - Ensure that not only your app code but also your network, security group, and policy definitions are stored in the pipeline, with automatic checks:
     - This creates a fully self-service environment for dev teams, reducing manual interventions further.

1. **Set Zero-Downtime Deployment Goals**
   - If you haven’t already, aim for zero user-impact deployments:
     - e.g., advanced canary or rolling strategies in every environment, with automated rollback if user metrics degrade.

By experimenting with AI-driven pipeline intelligence, chaos engineering, advanced zero-downtime deployment strategies, and cross-department collaboration, you continue pushing the boundaries of high-speed, highly reliable build/deployment processes—reinforcing your position as a leader in efficient operations within the UK public sector.

**Keep doing what you’re doing,** and consider creating blog posts or internal case studies to document your continuous improvement journey. You can also submit pull requests to this guidance or related public sector best-practice repositories, helping others learn from your approach to fast and dependable build/deployment processes.
