## How does your organization monitor and observe its cloud infrastructure and application data?[radios] =

() **Reactive and Development-Focused Observation:** Observations are primarily made during the development phase or in response to issues, with no continuous monitoring in place.
() **Basic Monitoring Tools and Manual Checks:** Basic monitoring tools are used. Checks are often manual and are not fully integrated across different cloud services.
() **Systematic Monitoring with Alerts:** Systematic monitoring is in place with alert systems for potential issues. However, the integration of infrastructure and application data is still developing.
() **Advanced Monitoring with Partial Integration:** Advanced monitoring tools are used, providing more comprehensive data. There's a degree of integration between infrastructure and application monitoring, but it's not fully seamless.
() **Integrated 'Single Pane of Glass' Monitoring:** A sophisticated, integrated monitoring system is in place, offering a 'single pane of glass' view. This system provides actionable insights from both infrastructure and application data.
