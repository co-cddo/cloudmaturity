### **No Dedicated Cloud Team:** There is no specific team focusing on cloud strategy; teams operate in silos based on traditional, on-premises role definitions.

### **Informal Cloud Expertise:** Informal groups or individuals with cloud expertise exist, facilitating some degree of cross-organizational collaboration.

### **Formal Cross-Functional Cloud Team/COE:** A formal Cloud Center of Excellence or equivalent cross-functional team exists, providing foundational support and guidance for cloud operations.

### **Integrated Cloud Teams Following COE Standards:** Cloud teams across the organization follow standards and patterns established by the Cloud COE. Cross-functional roles are increasingly common within development teams.

### **Advanced Cloud COE Operating Model:** The Cloud COE has matured into a comprehensive operating model with fully autonomous, cross-functional teams that include experts in all necessary technology and process domains.
