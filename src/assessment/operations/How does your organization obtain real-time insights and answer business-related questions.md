### **SME Analysis with Limited Data Literacy Understanding**: Insights largely depend on subject mater experts who analyze available data and provide answers. These experts, while knowledgeable in their field, may not always have a high level of data literacy, making the process more costly and only point in time, not real-time.

### **Basic Reporting Tools with Delayed Insights:** The organization uses basic reporting tools that provide insights, but there is typically a delay in data processing and limited real-time capabilities.

### **Intermediate Analytics with Some Real-Time Data:** A combination of analytics tools is used, offering some real-time data insights, though comprehensive, immediate access is limited.

### **Advanced Analytics Tools with Broad Real-Time Access:** The organization employs advanced analytics tools that provide broader access to real-time data, enabling quicker insights and decision-making.

### **Comprehensive Self-Service Dashboarding:** A self-service dashboarding capability is in place, offering wide access to various data points and enabling users across the organization to derive real-time insights independently.
