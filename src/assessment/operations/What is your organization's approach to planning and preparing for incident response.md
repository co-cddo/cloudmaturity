### **Ad-Hoc and Basic Efforts:** Incident response is primarily ad-hoc, with some basic efforts in place but no formalized plan or structured approach.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

If your organization responds to incidents (e.g., system outages, security breaches) in an improvised manner—relying on a few knowledgeable staff with no documented plan—you might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Few or Infrequent Incidents**

   - You have a small, stable environment where major disruptions are rare, so ad-hoc responses haven’t caused major negative impacts or compliance issues.

1. **Low-Risk Services**

   - The application or data in question is not critical to citizen services or departmental operations.
   - Failure or compromise does not pose significant security or privacy risks.

1. **Very Limited Resources**
   - Your team lacks the time or budget to formalize a plan, and you can handle occasional incidents with minimal fuss.

However, purely ad-hoc responses often lead to confusion, slower recovery times, and higher risk of mistakes. [NCSC’s incident management guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/incident-management) and [NIST SP 800-61 on Computer Security Incident Handling](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final) recommend having at least a documented process to ensure consistent, timely handling.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** steps to move beyond ad-hoc incident response:

1. **Draft a Simple Incident Response (IR) Checklist**

   - Outline basic steps for triage, analysis, containment, and escalation:
     - Who to notify, which logs to check, how to isolate affected systems, etc.
   - Reference [NCSC’s incident response best practices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/incident-management).

1. **Identify Key Roles**

   - Even if you can’t create a full incident response team, designate an incident lead and a communications point of contact.
   - Clarify who decides on severe actions (e.g., taking services offline).

1. **Set Up Basic Monitoring and Alerts**

   - Ensure you have at least minimal coverage:
     - [AWS GuardDuty, Security Hub, or CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html)
     - [Azure Sentinel or Monitor alerts for unusual activities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview)
     - [GCP Security Command Center or Cloud Logging-based alerts](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-overview)
     - [OCI Security Advisor or Logging with notifications for suspicious events](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Security/Concepts/security-advisor.htm)

1. **Coordinate with Third Parties**

   - If you rely on external suppliers or a cloud MSP, note their support lines and escalation processes in your checklist.

1. **Review and Refine After Each Incident**
   - Conduct a mini post-mortem for any downtime or breach, adding lessons learned to your ad-hoc plan.

By drafting a minimal IR checklist, assigning key roles, enabling basic alerts, and learning from each incident, you can quickly improve your readiness without a massive resource investment.

### **Initial Documentation at Service Launch:** A documented incident response plan is required and established at the point of introducing a new service to the live environment.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organization mandates that each new service or application must have a written incident response plan before going live. You might see it as "good enough" if:

1. **Consistent Baseline**

   - All teams know they must produce at least a minimal IR plan for each service, preventing complete ad-hoc chaos.

1. **Alignment with Launch Processes**

   - The IR plan is part of the "go-live" checklist, ensuring a modicum of readiness.
   - Teams consider logs, metrics, and escalation paths from the start.

1. **Improved Communication**
   - Stakeholders (e.g., dev, ops, security) discuss incident preparedness prior to launch, reducing confusion later.

While requiring IR documentation at service launch is beneficial, plans can become outdated if not revisited. Also, if the IR plan remains superficial, your team may not be fully prepared for evolving threats.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to strengthen an initial documented IR plan:

1. **Integrate IR Documentation into CI/CD**

   - If you maintain an Infrastructure as Code or pipeline approach, embed references to the IR plan or scripts:
     - e.g., one-liners explaining how to isolate or roll back in the event of a security alert.

1. **Automate Some Deployment Checks**

   - Before launch, run security scans or vulnerability checks:
     - [AWS Security Hub or Amazon Inspector during pipeline pre-check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-security-hub.html)
     - [Azure DevOps Pipeline tasks with Microsoft Defender for DevOps scanning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-devops/get-started)
     - [GCP Cloud Build triggers for container or code vulnerability checks](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/build-triggers)
     - [OCI DevOps pipeline scanning or Oracle Security Advisor integration](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DevOps/Concepts/devops-overview.htm)

1. **Link IR Plan to Monitoring Dashboards**

   - Provide direct references in the plan to the dashboards or logs used for incident detection:
     - This helps new team members quickly identify relevant data sources in a crisis.

1. **Consult Gov & NCSC Patterns**

   - Reference [NIST SP 800-61 Section 3.2 "Incident Handling Checklist"](https://csrc.nist.gov/) or [NCSC Cloud Security guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security) to flesh out robust procedures.

1. **Schedule a 3-Month Review Post-Launch**
   - Ensure the IR plan is updated after initial real-world usage.
   - Adjust for any changes in architecture or newly discovered risks.

By embedding IR considerations into your pipeline, linking them to monitoring resources, referencing official guidance, and doing a post-launch review, you maintain an up-to-date plan that effectively handles incidents as the service evolves.

### **Regularly Updated Incident Plan:** The incident response plan is not only documented but also periodically reviewed and updated to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Here, your organization’s IR plan is living documentation. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Periodic Reviews**

   - Your security or ops teams revisit the IR plan at least quarterly or after notable incidents.
   - Updates reflect changes in architecture, threat landscape, or staff roles.

1. **Cross-Team Collaboration**

   - Dev, ops, security, and possibly legal or management teams give input on the IR plan, ensuring a well-rounded approach.

1. **Moderate Testing**
   - You occasionally run tabletop exercises or partial simulations to validate the plan.

Even so, you may enhance integration with broader IT continuity strategies or increase the frequency and realism of exercises. [NCSC’s incident response maturity guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/incident-management) typically advocates regular testing and cross-functional involvement.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to elevate a regularly updated IR plan:

1. **Link Plan Updates to Service/Org Changes**

   - If new microservices launch or staff roles shift, require an immediate plan review:
     - e.g., add or remove relevant escalation points, update monitoring references.

1. **Automate IR Plan Distribution**

   - Store the IR plan in version control (like GitHub), so everyone can see changes easily:
     - e.g., label each revision with a date or release tag.
   - This fosters transparency and avoids outdated copies lurking in email threads.

1. **Encourage DR Drills**

   - Expand on tabletop exercises by running limited real-world simulations:
     - e.g., intentionally degrade a non-critical environment to test the plan’s response steps.
   - Tools like [AWS Fault Injection Simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/what-is-fis.html), [Azure Chaos Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/overview), or [Chaos Mesh on GCP/OCI](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/simulate-gcp-chaos/) can facilitate chaos engineering.

1. **Include Ransomware or DDoS Scenarios**

   - Adapt the plan to cover advanced threats relevant to public sector services, referencing [NCSC’s ransomware guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/ransomware), [NIST SP 800-61 for incident categories](https://csrc.nist.gov/).

1. **Regular Stakeholder Briefings**
   - Present IR readiness status updates to leadership or departmental leads, aligning them with the IR plan improvements.

By linking plan updates to actual org changes, distributing it via version control, frequently testing via drills, and preparing for advanced threats, you maintain an agile, effective IR plan that evolves with your environment.

### **Integrated and Tested Plans:** Incident response planning is integrated into the broader IT and business continuity planning. Regular testing of the plan is conducted to validate procedures and roles.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

In this scenario, your incident response plan doesn’t sit in isolation— it’s part of a holistic approach to continuity, including DR (Disaster Recovery) and resilience. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Seamless Coordination**

   - If an incident occurs, your teams know how to escalate, who to contact in leadership, and how to pivot to DR or business continuity plans.

1. **Frequent Drills**

   - You test different scenarios (network outages, data breaches, cloud region failovers) multiple times per year, refining the plan each time.

1. **Proactive Risk Management**
   - The plan includes risk assessment outputs from continuity or resiliency committees, ensuring coverage of the top threats.

If you frequently test and unify IR with continuity, you likely handle incidents with minimal confusion. However, you can still refine procedures by adding ephemeral environment testing or advanced threat simulations. [NCSC guidance on exercising incident response](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/products-services/exercising) often recommends more thorough cross-team exercises.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to further optimize integrated, tested IR plans:

1. **Adopt Multi-Cloud or Region Failover Testing**

   - If your DR strategy includes shifting workloads to another cloud or region, periodically simulate it:
     - [AWS: cross-region DR tests with AWS CloudFormation or DR exercises using AWS DMS for failover data replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Tasks.CrossRegion.html)
     - [Azure: Site Recovery for cross-region replication, test failovers monthly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-test-failover-to-azure)
     - [GCP: multi-region replication of data or spanner failover tests to validate readiness](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/disaster-recovery)
     - [OCI: cross-region replication or DR sets in Oracle cloud, tested in scheduled intervals](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DR/Concepts/dr-overview.htm)

1. **Expand Real-Time Monitoring Integration**

   - Ensure that if an alert triggers a continuity plan, the IR process is automatically updated with relevant logs or metrics.
   - Tools like [AWS EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is-amazon-eventbridge.html), [Azure Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview), [GCP Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview), or [OCI Events](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/eventsoverview.htm) can route incidents to the correct channels instantly.

1. **Formalize Post-Incident Reviews**

   - Document everything in a post-mortem or "lessons learned" session, referencing [NCSC’s post-incident evaluation guidelines](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/incident-management).
   - Update the plan accordingly.

1. **Include Communication and PR**

   - Integrate public communication steps if your service is citizen-facing:
     - e.g., prepared statements or web page banners, referencing [GOV.UK best practices on emergency communications](https://www.gov.uk/).

1. **Use NIST 800-61 or NCSC Models**
   - Evaluate if your IR plan’s phases (preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, post-incident) align with recognized frameworks.

By simulating cross-region failovers, integrating real-time alert triggers with continuity plans, conducting thorough post-incident reviews, and weaving communications into the IR plan, you maintain a robust, seamlessly tested approach that can respond to diverse incident scenarios.

### **Rehearsed and Proven Response Capability:** Incident response plans are not only documented and regularly updated but also rigorously rehearsed. The organization is capable of successfully recovering critical systems within a working day.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At the highest maturity level, your IR plan is thoroughly integrated, tested, and refined. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Regular Full-Scale Exercises**

   - You conduct realistic incident drills—maybe even involving third-party audits or multi-department collaboration.
   - Failover or system restoration is verified with near real-time performance metrics.

1. **Near-Immediate Recovery**

   - Critical systems can be restored or replaced within hours, if not minutes, meeting strict RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) requirements.

1. **Cross-Government Readiness**
   - You coordinate IR planning with other public sector bodies where interdependencies exist (e.g., healthcare, local councils).

While already impressive, continuous improvement is possible through refining automation, advanced threat hunting, or adopting chaos engineering to test response to unknown failure modes. [NCSC’s advanced incident management guidelines](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/incident-management) recommend ongoing learning and adaptation.

#### **How to do better**

Even at this advanced stage, below are **rapidly actionable** refinements:

1. **Embed Chaos Drills**

   - Randomly inject failures or security anomalies in production-like environments to ensure IR readiness:
     - Tools like [AWS Fault Injection Simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/what-is-fis.html) or [Azure Chaos Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/overview) can orchestrate purposeful disruptions.
     - GCP or OCI can adopt open-source solutions like [Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/simulate-gcp-chaos/) for container-level fault injection.

1. **Adopt AI/ML-Driven Threat Detection**

   - Integrate advanced analytics for anomaly detection:
     - [AWS DevOps Guru](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/what-is-devops-guru.html) or [Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html)
     - [Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/what-is-sentinel) with ML insights
     - [GCP Cloud Anomaly Detection](https://cloud.google.com/ai/docs/anomaly-detection/overview)
     - [OCI Security Advisor](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Security/Concepts/security-advisor.htm) with ML-based patterns
   - This ensures you detect suspicious behavior even before explicit alerts fire.

1. **Coordinate Regional or Multi-department Exercises**

   - Team up with allied public bodies or departments to run a joint incident scenario, testing real collaborative processes.
   - Sharing data or responsibilities across agencies aligns with [NCSC’s multi-organization incident response guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/).

1. **Link IR Performance to Gov Accountability**

   - Provide leadership with metrics or dashboards that show how quickly critical services can be restored.
   - This fosters ongoing support for practicing and funding IR improvements.

1. **Benchmark with International Standards**
   - Assess if your IR process meets or exceeds frameworks like [NIST SP 800-61], [ISO 27035], or related global best practices.
   - Update or fine-tune accordingly.

By regularly practicing chaos drills, leveraging AI-driven threat detection, collaborating with other agencies, and aligning with recognized international standards, your IR capabilities become even more robust. This ensures you stay prepared for evolving threats while maintaining compliance and demonstrating exceptional public sector resilience.

**Keep doing what you’re doing,** and consider writing up your incident response practice experiences (e.g., tabletop drills, real-world successes) in a blog post or internal case studies. Submit pull requests to this guidance or public sector best-practice repositories so others can learn from your advanced approaches to incident preparedness and response.
