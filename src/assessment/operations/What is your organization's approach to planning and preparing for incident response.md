### **Ad-Hoc and Basic Efforts:** Incident response is primarily ad-hoc, with some basic efforts in place but no formalized plan or structured approach.

### **Initial Documentation at Service Launch:** A documented incident response plan is required and established at the point of introducing a new service to the live environment.

### **Regularly Updated Incident Plan:** The incident response plan is not only documented but also periodically reviewed and updated to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

### **Integrated and Tested Plans:** Incident response planning is integrated into the broader IT and business continuity planning. Regular testing of the plan is conducted to validate procedures and roles.

### **Rehearsed and Proven Response Capability:** Incident response plans are not only documented and regularly updated but also rigorously rehearsed. The organization is capable of successfully recovering critical systems within a working day.
