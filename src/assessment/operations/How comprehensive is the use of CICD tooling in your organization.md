### **No CI/CD Tooling:** Traditional build, test, and deploy practices are in use, with no implementation of CI/CD tooling.

### **Limited CI/CD Tooling on Some Projects:** CI/CD tooling is used by some projects, but there are no formal standards or widespread adoption across the organization.

### **Varied CI/CD Tooling Across Teams:** Many project teams use CI/CD tooling, though the choice of tools and practices is based on individual team preferences.

### **Widespread, Team-Preferred CI/CD Tooling:** Most project teams employ CI/CD tooling, largely based on team preferences, with traditional practices being very limited.

### **Standardized and Consistent CI/CD Practices:** A standardized CI/CD pipeline is consistently used across project teams organization-wide, indicating a high level of maturity in deployment practices.
