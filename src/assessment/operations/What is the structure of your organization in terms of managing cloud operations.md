### **Developer-Managed Cloud Operations:** There is no dedicated cloud team; application developers are responsible for managing all aspects of cloud operations.

### **Fully Outsourced Cloud Operations and Strategy:** All cloud operations, including the definition of strategic direction, are outsourced to a third-party supplier.

### **Outsourced Operations with Internal Strategic Ownership:** Cloud operations are outsourced, but the strategic direction for cloud usage is developed and owned internally by the department.

### **Hybrid Approach with Outsourced Augmentation:** A mix of in-house and outsourced resources is used. Third-party suppliers provide additional capabilities (e.g., on-call support), while strategic cloud direction is led by departmental leaders.

### **Dedicated In-House Cloud Team:** A robust, dedicated cloud team exists within the organization, comprising at least 5 civil/public servant employees per cloud platform. This team has a shared roadmap for cloud capabilities, adoption, and migration.
