### **Ad-Hoc Management by Administrators:** Privileged credentials are managed on an ad-hoc basis by individual system administrators, without standardized processes.

### **Centralized Controls with Basic Vaulting:** Technology controls are in place for centralized management, including initial password and key vaulting, integrated logs, and policy-based activities.

### **Structured Identity Administration with OTPs:** Identity administration controls and processes are established for managing privileged access, including the use of one-time passwords (OTPs).

### **Automated Risk-Based Access Control:** Privileged access is managed through automated, risk-based workflows and controls. This includes consistent monitoring across cloud platforms.

### **Context-Aware Just-in-Time Privileges:** Access is granted on a just-in-time basis, using contextual factors to determine necessity (e.g., time-based access for critical tasks). Real-time alerting is in place for all activity, with mandatory wash-ups that require Senior leadership present, prioritization given to automating and preventing further need.
