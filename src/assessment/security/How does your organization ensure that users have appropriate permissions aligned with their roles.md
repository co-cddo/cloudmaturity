### **Ad-Hoc and Informal Review Process:** User entitlements and profiles are reviewed in an ad-hoc, informal manner with administrators manually managing these as they see fit.

### **Periodic Manual Reviews with Limited Action:** Periodic manual reviews of access rights are conducted for some systems, but access is rarely revoked or reduced due to concerns about unintended consequences.

### **Regular Manual Reviews, Primarily Additive:** Regular, manual reviews of access rights are conducted across most systems. However, changes to access are generally additive rather than reductive.

### **Regular Reviews with Defined Expiry Dates:** Access is regularly reviewed, certified, and remediated. Role allocations include defined expiry dates, necessitating review and re-certification.

### **Automated, Risk-Based Access Reviews:** Fully integrated, automated reviews ensure users have permissions appropriate to their roles. Access rights are dynamically adjusted based on role changes or review outcomes. Both access roles and their allocations have expiry dates for mandatory review and re-certification.
