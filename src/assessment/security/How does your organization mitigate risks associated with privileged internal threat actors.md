### **Vetting of Privileged Users:** All users with privileged access undergo thorough internal vetting (Internal/UKSV) or are vetted according to supplier/contractual requirements.

### **Audit Logs as a Non-Functional Requirement:** Systems are required to maintain audit logs, although these logs lack technical controls for centralization or comprehensive monitoring.

### **Local Audit Log Checks During Assessments:** Local audit log presence is verified as part of Integrated Technical Health Checks (ITHC) or other pre-launch processes, but routine monitoring may be absent.

### **Centralized, Immutable Audit Logs with Automated Monitoring:** Immutable system audit logs are centrally stored. Their integrity is continuously assured, and the auditing process is automated. Log retention is defined and enforced automatically.

### **Regular Audits and Legal Compliance Checks:** Regular rehearsal exercises are conducted with the assistance of auditors and legal experts. These checks ensure the integrity, completeness, and legal admissibility of logs as key evidence in potential criminal prosecutions.
