### **Traditional Network Perimeter Security:** Security relies primarily on network-level controls like IP-based allow-lists and firewall rules to create a secure perimeter around hosted data and applications.

### **Network Security with Basic Identity Verification:** The traditional network-based security perimeter is supplemented with mechanisms to verify user identity within the context of access requests.

### **Enhanced Identity Verification:** Security includes verification of both user and service identities in the context of requests, augmenting the network-based security perimeter.

### **Partial Shift to Identity-Centric Security:** In some areas, the network-based security perimeter is replaced by robust identity verification mechanisms for users and services, reducing the reliance on VPNs for secure access.

### **No Reliance on Network Perimeter or VPN:** The organization has moved away from a network-based security perimeter. Access control is centered around individual devices and users, requiring strong attestations for trust establishment.
