### **Encouraged but Not Enforced:** 2FA/MFA is broadly recommended in organizational guidelines, but it is not mandatory or consistently enforced across services and users.

### **Mandated but Inconsistently Enforced:** 2FA/MFA is a requirement for all services and users, but enforcement is inconsistent and may have gaps.

### **Uniform Enforcement with Some Exceptions:** 2FA/MFA is uniformly enforced across all services and users, with only a few exceptions based on specific use cases or risk assessments.

### **Prohibition of Vulnerable 2FA/MFA Methods:** Stronger 2FA/MFA methods are enforced, explicitly excluding forms vulnerable to attacks like SIM swapping (e.g., SMS/phone-based methods).

### **Stringent 2FA/MFA with Hardware Key Management:** Only services supporting robust 2FA/MFA are used. Hardware-based MFA keys are centrally managed and distributed, ensuring high-security standards for authentication.
