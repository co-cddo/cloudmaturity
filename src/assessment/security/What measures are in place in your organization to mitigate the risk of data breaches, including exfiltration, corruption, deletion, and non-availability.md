### **Manual Data Access Classification:** Data access is primarily managed through manual classification, with minimal automation or centralized control.

### **Centralized Policies and Controls:** A centralized set of policies and controls is in place to prevent unauthorized data access, forming the core of the data security strategy.

### **Policies with Limited Monitoring:** In addition to centralized policies and controls, limited monitoring for data exfiltration is conducted to identify potential breaches.

### **Comprehensive Controls with Automated Detection:** Preventative, detective, and corrective controls are implemented. Anomaly detection and correction are automated using a range of platforms and tools, providing a more robust defense.

### **Fully Automated Security and Proactive Monitoring:** Advanced, fully automated controls and anomaly detection systems are in place. This includes proactive monitoring, regular access reviews, and continuous auditing to ensure data security and compliance.
