### **Independent Identity Management:** Each service manages identities independently, without integration or synchronization across systems.

### **Basic Centralized Identity System:** There is a centralized system for identity management, but it's not fully integrated across all services.

### **Integrated Identity Management with Some Exceptions:** Identities are mostly managed through an integrated system, with a few services still operating independently.

### **Advanced Integrated Identity Management:** A comprehensive system manages identities, integrating most services and applications, with efforts to ensure synchronization and uniformity.

### **Mandatory Single Source of Identity:** A single source of identity is mandated for all services, with a strict one-to-one mapping of human to identity, ensuring consistency and security across the organization.
