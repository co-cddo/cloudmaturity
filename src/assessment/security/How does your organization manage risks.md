### **Basic and Informal Risk Management:** Risk management is carried out in a basic and informal manner, often relying on individual judgement without structured processes.

### **Ad-Hoc Spreadsheets for Risk Tracking:** Risks are tracked using ad-hoc spreadsheets at the project or program level, without a standardized or centralized system.

### **Formalized Risk Registers with Periodic Reviews:** Formal risk registers are maintained for projects or programs, with risks reviewed and updated on a periodic basis.

### **Integrated Risk Management with Central Oversight:** A centralized risk management system is used, integrating risks from various projects or programs, with regular updates and reviews.

### **Advanced Risk Management Tool with Proactive Escalation:** A shared, advanced risk management tool is in place, allowing for tracking and managing risks across multiple projects or programs. This system supports informed prioritization and proactively escalates unacceptable risks.
