## How does your organization authenticate and manage user identities?[radios] =

() **Basic or No Identity Policies:** There are limited or no organization-wide identity policies, such as password policies, with minimal audit or enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.
() **Manual Identity Policy Enforcement:** While a common set of identity policies may exist, their enforcement and audit rely on manual efforts, such as retrospective analysis of logs or reports.
() **Partially Automated Identity Management:** Organization-wide identity policies, including 2FA/MFA for privileged accounts, are in place. Audit and enforcement processes are partially automated.
() **Advanced and Mostly Automated Identity Management:** Centralized identity policies and audit procedures, possibly including 2FA/MFA for all users and leveraging Single Sign-On (SSO). Most audit and enforcement activities are automated.
() **Fully Centralized and Automated Identity Management:** Comprehensive, fully centralized identity policies and audit procedures with complete automation in enforcement. Policies encompass enterprise-standard MFA and SSO. Automated certification processes for human users and system accounts are in place, especially for accessing sensitive data, along with on-demand reporting capabilities.
