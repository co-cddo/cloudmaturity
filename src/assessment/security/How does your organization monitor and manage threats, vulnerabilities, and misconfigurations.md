### **No Vulnerability Management:** It is not clear to a member of the public how they can report vulnerabilities in your systems.

### **Open Policy or Participation in Responsible Disclosure Platforms:** Clear instructions for responsible vulnerability disclosure are published, with a commitment to prompt response upon receiving reports, you may also have active participation in well-known responsible disclosure platforms to facilitate external reporting of vulnerabilities.

### **Automated Scanning and Regular Assessments:** Implementation of automated tools for scanning vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, combined with regular security assessments.

### **Proactive Threat Hunting and Incident Response:** Proactive threat hunting practices are in place. Incident response teams rapidly address identified threats and vulnerabilities, with some degree of automation in responses.

### **Comprehensive Security Operations with Red/Purple Teams:** Utilization of red teams (offensive security) and purple teams (combined offensive and defensive) for a full-spectrum security assessment. An empowered Security Operations Center (SOC) conducts at least annual and major change-based IT Health Checks (ITHC). Analysts prioritize and coordinate remediation of high-severity issues, with many mitigation actions automated and event-triggered.
