Welcome to the **Cloud Maturity Model and Assessment Tool**. This quick, self-guided assessment helps you understand where your organisation stands on various aspects of cloud usageâ€”covering governance, security, operations, cost management, and more. Each answer will generate immediate, targeted guidance, aligned with best practices from industry standards, [NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/), and [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/).

You can **begin** a new assessment now or **load** an existing report to build upon your previous results.
