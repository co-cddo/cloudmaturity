### **Minimal Interaction with Cloud Providers:** The relationship with cloud providers is transactional, brokered through a third party, and limited to accessing their services without any significant direct contact or support from their account or technical teams.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organisation may simply use a cloud provider’s console or basic services without actively engaging them for training, account management, or technical guidance. This might be considered "good enough" if:

1. **Low Cloud Adoption**

   - You only run a small set of workloads, and your staff have enough expertise to handle them without external help.

1. **Limited Requirements**

   - You have no pressing need for advanced features, cost optimisation, or architectural guidance.

1. **No Advanced Security/Compliance Demands**
   - Basic usage without deeper collaboration may suffice if your environment has minimal compliance or security constraints and your internal skills are adequate.

However, minimal engagement often leads to missed opportunities for cost savings, architecture improvements, or robust security best practices that a provider’s support team could offer—especially given [NCSC cloud security recommendations](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security) for public sector contexts.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** steps to move from minimal interaction to stronger collaboration with cloud providers:

1. **Set Up Basic Account Management Contacts**

   - Register for at least a standard or free tier of support:
     - [AWS: Basic or Developer Support, at least using AWS Support Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html)
     - [Azure: Basic support with options for pay-as-you-go Dev/Test support or higher tiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-manage-azure-support-request)
     - [GCP: Basic project-level support with an option to upgrade for faster response times](https://cloud.google.com/support)
     - [OCI: Basic limited support plus the option to engage an Oracle Cloud support representative](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Support/Concepts/support-overview.htm)
   - This ensures you know how to escalate issues if they arise.

1. **Use Vendor Documentation & Quickstart Guides**

   - Encourage staff to leverage official tutorials and quickstarts for key services (compute, storage, networking).
   - Reference [NIST Cloud Computing resources](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cloud-computing) for broad conceptual best practices.

1. **Attend Vendor Webinars/Events**

   - Cloud providers frequently hold free webinars or online sessions geared to public sector or cost optimisation:
     - [AWS Public Sector Webinars or re:Invent recordings](https://aws.amazon.com/events/webinars/)
     - [Azure Government events or on-demand training for Gov customers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing/azure-government-training)
     - [GCP for Public Sector resource library or Next conference sessions](https://cloud.google.com/public-sector/resources)
     - [OCI Government Cloud user sessions or Oracle University free training modules](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/government/training/)

1. **Implement Minimal Security Best Practices**

   - Even with minimal contact:
     - [NCSC cloud security: At least enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), basic logging, and encryption at rest.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security)

1. **Document Next Steps**
   - E.g., "In 3 months, explore a higher support tier or schedule a call with a provider solutions architect to discuss cost or architecture reviews."

By establishing basic contacts, using vendor quickstarts, tapping into free events, and implementing minimal security measures, you start reaping more value from your cloud provider relationship and set the stage for deeper engagement.

### **Basic Support Utilisation:** Some basic support services from cloud providers are utilised, such as occasional technical assistance or access to standard documentation and resources.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organisation has begun reaching out to the cloud provider’s support channels for assistance (e.g., tickets, phone calls, or chat) on an as-needed basis. This could be "good enough" if:

1. **Occasional Issues**

   - You typically resolve common problems quickly using vendor documentation, and only open support tickets for unusual or moderate complexity issues.

1. **Low Complexity or Growth**

   - Your environment is stable, not requiring advanced architecture reviews or cost optimisation sessions with provider specialists.

1. **Reasonable Timely Assistance**
   - The basic support meets your current operational SLA—especially if downtime or critical incidents remain infrequent.

Yet, to maximise public sector service resilience and cost efficiency, you might benefit from more proactive outreach, architecture reviews, or training options. [NCSC’s operational resilience guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/operational-resilience) often recommends deeper engagement for critical digital services.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to evolve beyond basic support:

1. **Establish Regular Check-Ins with Account Managers**

   - Request quarterly calls or monthly updates:
     - [AWS TAM (Technical Account Manager) if using Business or Enterprise Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/)
     - [Azure Customer Success resources or Partner-led success check-ins](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing/azure-government-training)
     - [GCP Technical Account Manager or Customer Engineer sessions for deeper insights](https://cloud.google.com/support)
     - [OCI dedicated support managers if you have Enhanced or Premier tiers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Support/Concepts/support-overview.htm)

1. **Request Architecture/Cost Reviews**

   - Providers typically offer free or low-cost reviews to identify cost-saving or performance improvements:
     - e.g., AWS Well-Architected Review, Azure Architecture Review, GCP Architecture Check, OCI Architecture Center.

1. **Attend or Organise Vendor-Led Training**

   - Encourage staff to attend vendor-led courses or sign up for [NCSC-endorsed cloud security training materials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) if available.
   - This builds internal skill sets, reducing reliance on ad-hoc support.

1. **Leverage Vendor Communities & Forums**

   - For quick answers outside official tickets, use:
     - [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/en/groups/cloud-community)
     - [Azure Forums](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/forums/)
     - [GCP Community](https://cloud.google.com/community)
     - [OCI Community](https://community.oracle.com/community/cloud-infrastructure)

1. **Institute a "Support Triage" Process**
   - Define guidelines on which issues can be solved internally vs. escalated to the provider to expedite resolution times.
   - Helps staff know when to open tickets and what info to include.

By scheduling regular check-ins with account managers, requesting architecture and cost reviews, organising training sessions, and clarifying a support triage process, you step up from reactive usage of basic support to a more proactive and beneficial relationship.

### **Regular Interaction and Support:** There is regular interaction with cloud provider account managers, including access to standard training and support services to assist in leveraging cloud capabilities.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this stage, your organisation has established a relationship with the provider’s account or technical teams, periodically engaging them for advice or standard support. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Frequent Exchanges**

   - Monthly or quarterly calls, email updates, or Slack channels with the provider’s team, leading to timely advice on new services.

1. **Technical Workshops**

   - You’ve participated in fundamental training or architecture sessions that help refine your environment.

1. **Clear Escalation Paths**
   - If major incidents occur or you need advanced cost optimisation, you know how to escalate within the provider’s organisation.

While this approach can keep your environment stable and cost-aware, you could further deepen the partnership for tailored solutions, specialised trainings, or advanced architecture reviews aligned with public sector compliance. [NCSC’s supply chain guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/products-services/supplier-assurance) encourages robust vendor relationships that go beyond minimal interactions.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to leverage regular provider interaction more effectively:

1. **Pursue Dedicated Technical Engagement**

   - If your usage or complexity warrants it, consider an advanced support tier:
     - [AWS Enterprise or AWS Proactive Engagement with AWS Shield if you need strong DDoS protection](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/)
     - [Azure Premier Support or Microsoft FastTrack for specialized migrations](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing/azure-government-training)
     - [GCP’s Premium Support or Technical Account Manager services for in-depth architecture collaboration](https://cloud.google.com/support)
     - [OCI’s Advanced Customer Support for proactive monitoring and best practice alignment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Support/Concepts/support-overview.htm)

1. **Targeted Workshops for Specific Projects**

   - Request solution architecture workshops tailored to, say, big data analytics, HPC, or IoT in the public sector context.
   - Align these with departmental goals, referencing [NIST Big Data guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/) or [NCSC data security advice](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/).

1. **Co-Develop a Cloud Roadmap**

   - With the provider’s account manager, outline next-year priorities: e.g., expansions to new regions, adopting serverless, or cost optimisation drives.
   - Ensure these are documented in a shared action plan.

1. **Engage in Beta/Preview Programs**

   - Providers often invite customers to test new features, offering direct input.
   - This can yield early insights into tools beneficial for your departmental use cases.

1. **Share Feedback on Public Sector Needs**
   - Raise local government, NHS, or departmental compliance concerns so the provider can adapt or recommend solutions (e.g., private endpoints, advanced encryption key management).

By scheduling advanced support tiers or specialised workshops, co-developing a cloud roadmap, participating in early feature programs, and continuously feeding back public sector requirements, you strengthen the partnership for mutual benefit.

### **Proactive Engagement and Tailored Support:** The organisation engages proactively with cloud providers, receiving tailored support, training, and workshops that align with specific needs and goals.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

In this scenario, your interactions with the provider aren’t just frequent—they’re customised for your department’s unique challenges and objectives. You might see it as "good enough" if:

1. **Joint Planning**

   - Provider and internal teams hold planning sessions (quarterly or bi-annual) to match new services with your roadmap.

1. **Customised Training**

   - You have in-person or virtual workshops focusing on your tech stack (e.g., AWS for HPC, Azure for AI, GCP for serverless, OCI for specialised Oracle workloads) and departmental constraints.

1. **Aligned Security & Compliance**

   - Providers work closely with you on meeting [NCSC cloud security guidelines](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security) or internal audits, possibly crafting special architectures for compliance.

1. **High Adoption of Best Practices**
   - You regularly adopt well-architected reviews, cost optimisation sessions, or advanced managed services to streamline operations.

If your environment thrives under this proactive arrangement, you likely gain from reduced operational overhead and timely adoption of new features. Nonetheless, you can often elevate to a fully strategic partnership that involves co-marketing or advanced cloud transformation programs.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to deepen this proactive, tailored relationship:

1. **Establish Joint Success Criteria**

   - e.g., "Reduce average monthly cloud cost by 20%," or "Achieve 99.95% uptime with no unplanned downtime over the next quarter."
   - Collaborate with the provider’s solution architects to measure progress monthly.

1. **Conduct Regular Technical Deep-Dives**

   - If using advanced analytics or HPC, schedule monthly architecture feedback with vendor specialists who can propose further optimisation or new service usage.
   - Incorporate relevant [NIST SP 500-299 HPC guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/) or domain-specific standards if relevant.

1. **Engage in Co-Innovation Programs**

   - Some providers run "co-innovation labs" or pilot programs specifically for public sector transformations:
     - [AWS Public Sector Innovation Sandbox](https://aws.amazon.com/public-sector/innovation-sandbox/)
     - [Azure Gov Hackathons](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing/azure-government-training)
     - [GCP Public Sector pilots](https://cloud.google.com/public-sector/resources)
     - [OCI Government Co-development](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/government/co-development/)

1. **Formalise an Enhancement Request Process**

   - For feature gaps or special compliance needs, let your account team log these requests, referencing [NCSC or GOV.UK requirements].
   - Potentially expedite solutions that meet public sector demand.

1. **Public Sector Showcases**
   - Offer to speak at vendor events or in case studies, highlighting your success:
     - This often results in further tailored support or early access to relevant solutions.

By defining success metrics, scheduling technical deep-dives, pursuing co-innovation, and ensuring an open channel for feature requests, you make the most of your proactive provider engagement—driving continuous improvement in alignment with public sector priorities.

### **Strategic Partnership with Comprehensive Support:** Cloud providers are engaged as strategic partners, offering comprehensive support, including regular training, workshops, and active collaboration. This partnership is instrumental in realising strategic goals and includes opportunities for the organisation to showcase its work through the provider's platforms.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this highest maturity stage, your organisation forms a deep strategic alliance with the provider, leveraging broad support and showcasing initiatives publicly. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Integrated Strategic Alignment**

   - You and the provider co-plan multi-year roadmaps, ensuring cloud solutions directly serve departmental missions (e.g., digital inclusion, citizen service modernisation).

1. **Extensive Training & Development**

   - Your staff frequently attend advanced workshops or immersion days, possibly earning official cloud certifications.

1. **Joint Marketing or Showcasing**

   - The provider invites you to speak at summits or user conferences, highlighting your innovative public sector achievements.

1. **Robust and Timely Innovation**
   - You often test or adopt new services early (alpha/beta features) with the provider’s help, shaping them to UK public sector needs.

While you may already be a leader in cloud adoption, continuous adaptation to new threats, technologies, and compliance updates remains essential. [NCSC’s agile resilience approach](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) suggests regular updates and real-world exercises to preserve top-tier readiness.

#### **How to do better**

Even at this advanced level, below are **rapidly actionable** ways to refine a strategic partnership:

1. **Co-Develop Advanced Pilots**

   - Test cutting-edge solutions, e.g., advanced AI/ML for predictive analytics, HPC for large-scale modeling:
     - Align with [NIST AI frameworks](https://csrc.nist.gov/) or specialised vendor HPC solutions.
   - This pushes your public sector services into future-forward innovations.

1. **Integrate Multi-Cloud or Hybrid Strategies**

   - If relevant, partner with multiple providers while ensuring secure, consistent management:
     - [NCSC multi-cloud security considerations](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security) or vendor multi-cloud bridging solutions ([Azure Arc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/overview), [GCP Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos), [AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/), [OCI Interconnect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Interconnect/Concepts/interconnectoverview.htm))

1. **Spearhead Cross-Government Collaborations**

   - Collaborate with local councils, NHS, or other agencies—invite them to share your advanced partnership benefits, referencing [GOV.UK’s cross-government digital approach](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).
   - Potentially form shared procurement or compliance frameworks with the provider’s help.

1. **Ensure Regular, Comprehensive Security Drills**

   - Pair with your provider for joint incident simulations, verifying consistent coverage of best practices:
     - e.g., region failovers, advanced DDoS scenarios, referencing [NCSC’s DDoS protection guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) and the provider’s protective services.

1. **Establish a Lessons Learned Repository**
   - Each joint initiative or advanced workshop should produce shareable documentation or "playbooks," continuously updating your knowledge base for broader departmental usage.

By pushing into co-developed pilots, multi-cloud or hybrid expansions, cross-government collaborations, advanced security drills, and structured knowledge sharing, you maintain a forward-looking, fully integrated partnership with your cloud provider—ensuring ongoing alignment with strategic public sector aspirations.

**Keep doing what you’re doing,** and consider sharing your experiences (e.g., co-pilots, advanced solutions) in blog posts or on official channels. Submit pull requests to this guidance or related best-practice repositories to help others in the UK public sector benefit from your advanced collaborations with cloud providers.
