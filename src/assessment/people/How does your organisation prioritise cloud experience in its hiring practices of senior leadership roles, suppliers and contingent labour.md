### **No Specific Cloud Experience Requirement:** Cloud experience is not a requirement in job postings; candidates are not specifically sought out for their cloud skills.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organisation’s job postings do not mention or require cloud knowledge from applicants—even for senior/leadership roles. This could be "good enough" if:

1. **Minimal or No Cloud Usage**

   - You operate almost entirely on-premises, with no plan or mandate to expand cloud operations in the near term.

1. **Highly Specialised Legacy Roles**

   - Your roles focus on traditional IT (e.g., mainframe, specialised on-prem hardware), making cloud background less immediately relevant.

1. **Solely Vendor or Outsourced Cloud Expertise**
   - You rely on a third-party supplier for cloud design and operations, so hiring for in-house cloud capability seems unnecessary.

However, ignoring cloud experience can become a blocker if your organisation decides to modernise or scale digital services. [NCSC’s strategic cloud adoption guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security) and [GOV.UK’s Cloud First policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy) often suggest building at least some internal cloud capability to ensure secure and efficient usage.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** steps to begin emphasizing cloud skills in hiring:

1. **Add Cloud Awareness to Job Descriptions**

   - Even if not mandatory, mention "cloud awareness" or "willingness to learn cloud technologies" for relevant roles.
   - Encourage upskilling referencing free training from [AWS Skill Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/training/skill-builder/), [Azure Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/), [GCP Skill Boost](https://cloud.google.com/training/free-tier), or [OCI Free Training](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/oci-training/).

1. **Encourage Current Staff to Share Cloud Knowledge**

   - If you have even one or two employees with cloud expertise, host internal lunchtime talks or short workshop sessions.
   - Build a minor internal market for cloud knowledge so that future roles can specify these basic competencies.

1. **Prepare for Cloud-Focused Future**

   - If you have a known modernisation program, consider building a pipeline of cloud-savvy talent:
     - Start by adding basic cloud competence to "desired" (not required) criteria in some new roles.

1. **Reference NIST & NCSC Workforce Guidance**

   - For instance, [NIST SP 800-181 National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/) provides role-based skill guidelines, which can be extended to cloud roles.
   - [NCSC guidance on building a cloud-ready workforce](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) can help formalise job competencies.

1. **Short Internal Hackathons**
   - Let staff explore a simple cloud project, e.g., deploying a test app or serverless function.
   - This stirs interest in cloud skills, naturally leading to job postings that mention them.

By introducing even minor cloud awareness requirements, providing internal knowledge sharing, referencing official frameworks, and organising small hackathons, you start shifting your hiring practices to future-proof your organisation’s cloud readiness.

### **Selective Requirement for Cloud Experience:** Some job postings, particularly those in relevant areas, require candidates to have prior cloud experience.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organisation mentions cloud skills for roles that clearly need them (e.g., DevOps, security engineering), while other positions (senior leadership, less technical roles) remain silent on cloud. This may be "good enough" if:

1. **Targeted Cloud Adoption**

   - Only certain teams or projects are using cloud extensively, so broad-based cloud requirements aren’t mandatory.

1. **Reasonable Cost/Benefit**

   - The budget and number of critical cloud roles are matched, so your approach to selectively recruiting cloud talent covers current demands.

1. **Manager-Led Approach**
   - Hiring managers decide which roles should involve cloud experience, ensuring teams that do need it get the right people.

While this step ensures crucial roles have the necessary cloud skills, it may cause gaps in leadership or strategic roles if they remain cloud-agnostic. [GDS leadership roles often emphasize digital knowledge](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), so integrating cloud awareness can future-proof your organisation’s direction.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** improvements:

1. **Include Cloud Skills for Leadership**

   - For senior or executive positions that influence technology strategy, add "awareness of cloud architectures and security" to the job description.
   - This aligns with modern public sector digital leadership standards.

1. **Establish Clear Criteria**

   - Define which roles "must have," "should have," or "could have" cloud experience:
     - e.g., for a principal engineer or head of infrastructure, cloud experience is "must have." For a data analyst, it might be "should have" or optional.

1. **Collaborate with HR or Recruitment**

   - Ensure recruiters understand terms like "AWS Certified Solutions Architect," "Azure DevOps Engineer Expert," or "GCP Professional Cloud Architect."
   - They can better filter or source candidates if they know relevant cloud certifications or skill sets.

1. **Assess Supplier Cloud Proficiency**

   - When contracting or hiring contingent labor, require them to demonstrate cloud capabilities (like having staff certified to a certain level).
   - Reference [NCSC supply chain security guidelines](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security) to set minimal standards for external vendors.

1. **Offer Pathways for Internal Staff**
   - Provide existing employees an option to upskill into these "cloud-required" roles, reinforcing a culture of growth.
   - Supports staff retention and aligns with [NIST workforce development frameworks](https://csrc.nist.gov/).

By adding leadership-level cloud awareness, clarifying role-based cloud criteria, ensuring recruiters or contingent labor providers understand these requirements, and offering internal upskilling, you create a more consistent approach that meets both immediate and long-term organisational needs.

### **Mandatory Cloud Experience for Relevant Roles:** All relevant job postings mandate cloud experience, aligning with the Digital, Data, and Technology (DDaT) role definitions.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organisation has moved to standardising cloud skill requirements in line with official frameworks, such as the [GOV.UK DDaT profession capability framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework). This may be "good enough" if:

1. **Clear, Public Guidance**

   - Each role linked to "DDaT job family" or similar has explicit cloud knowledge expectations in the job descriptions.

1. **Established Cloud Culture**

   - Colleagues in relevant fields (DevOps, architecture, security) all share a baseline of cloud competencies, ensuring consistent approaches across teams.

1. **Confidence in Ongoing Staff Development**
   - You provide channels for employees to refresh or deepen their cloud skills (e.g., training budgets, exam vouchers).

If this meets your organisational scale—balancing modern service delivery with consistent cloud capabilities—it might be sufficient. Still, you can refine existing roles and adapt as the cloud environment evolves, ensuring continuous alignment with best practices from [NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) and [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/).

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to advance beyond simple mandatory requirements:

1. **Regularly Update Role Profiles**

   - As AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI evolve, review job descriptions annually:
     - e.g., adding modern DevSecOps patterns, container orchestration, serverless, or big data capabilities.

1. **Introduce Cloud Competency Levels**

   - e.g., "Level 1 – Cloud Foundations," "Level 2 – Advanced Cloud Practitioner," "Level 3 – Cloud Architect."
   - This ensures clarity about skill depth for each role, linking to vendor certifications.

1. **Ensure Continuity & Succession**

   - Plan for staff turnover by establishing robust knowledge transfer processes, referencing [NCSC workforce security advice](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/).
   - Minimises risk if a key cloud-skilled individual leaves.

1. **Promote Multi-Cloud Awareness**

   - If your organisation uses more than one provider, encourage roles to include cross-provider or "cloud-agnostic" concepts:
     - e.g., Terraform, Kubernetes, or zero-trust security patterns relevant across AWS, Azure, GCP, or OCI.

1. **Involve Senior Leadership**
   - Demonstrate how mandatory cloud experience in roles directly supports mission-critical public services, cost optimisation, or security compliance, building top-level buy-in.

By routinely revising DDaT role definitions to keep pace with evolving cloud tech, defining competency levels, planning continuity, encouraging multi-cloud knowledge, and securing leadership sponsorship, you firmly embed cloud skill requirements into your organisational DNA.

### **Updated Role Requirements and Cloud-Focused Hiring:** In addition to requiring cloud experience for new hires, existing roles have been reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect a cloud-first IT organisation.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organisation not only mandates cloud experience for new roles but also revises current positions, ensuring all necessary staff have relevant cloud responsibilities. You might see it as "good enough" if:

1. **Comprehensive Role Audit**

   - You have completed an organisation-wide review of each position’s cloud skill requirements.

1. **Seamless Transition**

   - Incumbent staff received training or redefined job objectives, mapping on-prem tasks to modern cloud tasks.

1. **Consistent Cloud Readiness**
   - Department-wide, roles reflect a cloud-first approach—nobody is left operating purely on older skill sets if they have critical cloud duties.

Yet, as your environment or services evolve, you may consider advanced role specialisation (e.g., HPC, big data, AI/ML) or deeper multi-cloud skills. [NCSC’s security frameworks](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) might also push you to refine role-based security responsibilities.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** methods to keep role definitions agile in a cloud-first IT organisation:

1. **Periodically Revalidate Roles**

   - Introduce a yearly review cycle where HR, IT leadership, and line managers re-check if roles align with current cloud usage or new compliance mandates (like [NIST SP 800-53 revision updates](https://csrc.nist.gov/)).

1. **Provide Upgrade Path for Existing Staff**

   - Offer training or special secondments so staff who were initially on-prem can adapt to cloud:
     - e.g., an internal "cloud transformation bootcamp," referencing [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/training/skill-builder/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/training/free-tier), [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/), or [OCI](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/oci-training/) training labs.

1. **Embed Cloud in Performance Management**

   - Align staff appraisal or objective-setting with adoption of new cloud skills, cost-saving initiatives, or security improvements.

1. **Create a Cloud Champion Network**

   - For each department, designate "cloud champions" who ensure local roles remain updated and can escalate new skill demands if usage evolves.

1. **Follow GOV.UK or DDaT ‘Career Paths’**
   - Cross-check with official [Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) role definitions on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework) to ensure your newly updated roles align with common public sector standards.

By systematically revalidating roles, offering staff training for on-prem to cloud transitions, linking performance metrics to cloud initiatives, and referencing official frameworks, you future-proof your team structures in a dynamic cloud landscape.

### **Comprehensive Cloud Experience Requirement and Role Adaptation:** All job postings require cloud experience, and every existing role within the organisation has been evaluated and updated where necessary to align with the needs of a cloud-first IT organisation.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this top maturity level, your organisation has fully embraced a cloud-first model: all new and existing roles incorporate cloud knowledge. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Uniform Cloud Culture**

   - Cloud capabilities are not a niche skill; the entire workforce, from leadership to IT specialists, understands cloud fundamentals.

1. **Frequent Revisits to Role Definitions**

   - If new technologies or security best practices emerge, roles adapt quickly.

1. **Minimal Silos**

   - Cross-functional collaboration is straightforward, as everyone shares a baseline cloud understanding.

1. **Strong Public Sector Alignment**
   - Your approach aligns with [NCSC guidelines](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security) for secure cloud usage, [NIST frameworks](https://csrc.nist.gov/), and [GOV.UK cloud-first policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy) expectations.

Even so, continuous refinement remains important. Evolving multi-cloud strategies, advanced DevSecOps, or specialised HPC/AI solutions might require targeted skill sets.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** methods to keep your fully cloud-oriented workforce thriving:

1. **Nurture Advanced Specialisations**

   - Some roles may deepen knowledge in containers (Kubernetes), serverless, HPC, or big data analytics:
     - e.g., adopting advanced AWS, Azure, GCP, or OCI certifications for architecture, security, or data engineering.

1. **Embed Continuous Learning**

   - Offer staff consistent updates, hack days, or vendor-led labs to adapt to new features quickly:
     - e.g., monthly community-of-practice sessions to discuss the latest cloud service releases or security advisories.

1. **Encourage Cross-Organisational Collaboration**

   - Collaborate with other UK public sector bodies, sharing roles or secondment opportunities for advanced cloud experiences.
   - This fosters a broader, more resilient talent pool across government.

1. **Pursue International or R&D Partnerships**

   - If your department engages in cutting-edge projects or HPC research, consider co-innovation programs with cloud providers or academic institutions:
     - This might spin up entirely new specialised roles (AI/ML ops, HPC performance engineer, etc.).

1. **Benchmark Against Leading Practices**
   - Leverage [NCSC or NIST case studies](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) to compare your staff skill frameworks with top-tier digital organisations.
   - Conduct periodic audits on the relevance of your role definitions and skill requirements.

By encouraging advanced specialisations, sustaining continuous learning, collaborating with other public sector entities, pursuing co-innovation partnerships, and benchmarking against top-tier best practices, you maintain an extremely robust, cloud-first workforce strategy that evolves with emerging technologies and public sector demands.

**Keep doing what you’re doing,** and consider writing blog posts or internal knowledge base articles about your journey toward fully integrating cloud skills into hiring. Submit pull requests to this guidance or other public sector best-practice repositories, sharing lessons learned to help others adopt a comprehensive, future-ready cloud workforce strategy.
