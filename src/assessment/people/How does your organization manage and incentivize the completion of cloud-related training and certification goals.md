### **No Formal Training Support:** There is no formal support for certification or training, nor are any specific goals or targets defined for employee development in cloud skills.

### **Managerial Discretion on Training:** Training and certifications are supported at the discretion of individual managers. Team-level training goals are set but not consistently monitored or reported.

### **Corporate-Level Training Support and Tracking:** Training and certifications are strongly supported with allocated budgets and managerial encouragement. Team-level training goals are consistently defined, tracked, and reported at the corporate level.

### **Role-Based Training Recommendations and Self-Assessment:** Relevant certifications are recommended based on specific roles and incorporated into personal development plans. Employees are encouraged to self-assess their progress against role-specific and team-level goals.

### **Incentivized and Assessed Training Programs:** Employees completing certifications are rewarded with merit incentives and receive structured guidance and development plans. Periodic formal role-specific assessments are conducted, with achievements recognized through systems like GovUKCloudBadges.
