### **No Defined Success Criteria:** The cloud team operates without specific, defined criteria for measuring success.

### **Initial Achievements with Proofs of Concept:** Success is measured by completing initial proofs of concept or developing a 'minimum viable cloud/platform'.

### **Launching Workloads in Production:** Success includes transitioning one or more workloads into a live production environment on the cloud.

### **Scaling Prototypes to Core Services:** Success involves scaling initial prototypes to operate core technical services in the cloud, supporting business-critical applications.

### **Innovation and Value Creation Alignment:** The organization has established success criteria that not only focus on cloud-based innovation and experimentation but also on creating tangible value through transformation initiatives, all aligned with the organizationâ€™s broader goals and strategy.
