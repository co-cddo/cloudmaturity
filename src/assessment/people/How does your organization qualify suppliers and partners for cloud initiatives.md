### **Basic Qualification Based on Marketing and Framework Presence:** Selection is based primarily on the supplier's sales literature and their presence on commercial buying frameworks.

### **Initial Due Diligence and Basic Compliance Checks:** Suppliers are chosen through basic due diligence, focusing on compliance with minimum standards and requirements.

### **Moderate Screening for Experience and Compliance:** Partners are qualified based on their industry experience, compliance with relevant standards, and basic alignment with organizational needs.

### **Comprehensive Evaluation Including Technical and Ethical Alignment:** Suppliers are thoroughly vetted for technical competence, ethical alignment with organizational values, and their ability to support specific cloud objectives.

### **Strategic Selection with Emphasis on Long-Term Value and Leadership Vision:** Suppliers are selected based on a track record of excellence, recommendations from other departments, relevant certifications, demonstrable technical leadership, alignment with the civil service code, support for programs like apprenticeships, strong engagement with the leadership vision, clear articulation of risks, measurable KPIs, and long-term value for money.
