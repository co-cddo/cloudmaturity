### We don't plan for this.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organisation may not offer any structured way for employees to learn cloud technologies. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Minimal Cloud Footprint**
   - Your cloud usage is extremely limited, so extensive skill-building programs seem unnecessary.

1. **No Immediate Skill Gaps**
   - Current projects do not require additional cloud expertise, and operational requirements are met without training investments.

1. **Short-Term Budget or Resource Constraints**
   - Funding or leadership support for formal cloud training is unavailable at present.

However, a complete lack of development opportunities can lead to skill shortages if your cloud usage suddenly expands, or if staff who do have cloud expertise leave. [NCSC’s workforce security guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) and [NIST workforce frameworks](https://csrc.nist.gov/) often emphasize proactive skill-building to maintain operational security and resilience.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to establish a baseline development path for new cloud learners:

1. **Create a Simple Cloud Familiarisation Resource**
   - Gather free vendor tutorials:
     - [AWS free training modules or AWS Skill Builder basics](https://aws.amazon.com/training/skill-builder/)
     - [Azure Fundamentals on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-fundamentals/)
     - [GCP Google Cloud Skill Boost introduction courses](https://cloud.google.com/training/free-tier)
     - [OCI free introductory courses from Oracle University](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/oci-training/)
     - [IBM Cloud free training](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/get-ready-for-change-with-ibm-cloud-training?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=cloud%20training)
   - Provide a short list of recommended links to staff wanting to explore cloud concepts.

1. **Encourage Self-Study**
   - Offer small incentives (e.g., internal recognition or minor expense coverage) if employees complete a fundamental cloud course.
   - Even a simple certificate of completion fosters motivation.

1. **Promote Internal Shadowing**
   - If you have at least one cloud-savvy colleague, arrange informal shadowing or pair sessions.
   - This ensures staff with zero cloud background get exposure to real tasks.

1. **Reference GOV.UK and NCSC**
   - Link staff to relevant [GOV.UK digital and technology frameworks](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework) or basic [NCSC cloud security advice](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security).

1. **Pilot a Tiny Cloud Project**
   - If budget or time is tight, propose a small, non-critical cloud POC. Staff with no cloud experience can attempt deploying a simple website or serverless function, building basic confidence.

By assembling free training resources, sponsoring small incentives, and facilitating internal shadowing or mini pilots, you kickstart a foundational path for employees to begin acquiring cloud knowledge in a low-cost, organic way.

### We give basic on-the-job training.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

You may have a modest training approach, usually overseen by a line manager or a more experienced colleague. This can be "good enough" if:

1. **Gradual Cloud Adoption**
   - The environment is evolving slowly, so incremental on-the-job training meets the immediate need.

1. **In-House Mentors**
   - If there are enough knowledgeable staff who can guide newcomers on day-to-day tasks without overloading or risking burnout.

1. **Basic Organisational Support**
   - A policy exists allowing some time for new staff to learn cloud basics, but no formal structured training plan is in place.

While more robust than having no path, purely on-the-job learning can be inconsistent. Some staff might receive thorough guidance, while others do not, depending on who they pair with. A standardised approach can yield faster, more uniform results—aligned with [NCSC’s emphasis on skill-building for secure cloud operations](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/).

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to strengthen basic on-the-job cloud training:

1. **Define Simple Mentorship Guidelines**
   - Even if informally, specify a mentor’s role—e.g., conducting weekly check-ins, demonstrating best practices for provisioning, cost management, or security scanning.

1. **Adopt a Buddy System for Cloud Tasks**
   - Pair a novice with a more experienced engineer on actual cloud tickets or incidents:
   - Encourages learning through real-world problem-solving.

1. **Introduce a Lightweight Skills Matrix**
   - Track essential cloud tasks (e.g., spinning up a VM, setting up logging, basic security config) and check them off as novices learn:
     - e.g., [AWS/Azure/GCP/OCI basics], referencing relevant vendor quickstarts.

1. **Encourage Self-Paced Online Labs**
   - Provide access to some structured labs:
     - [AWS Hands-on labs, Azure Lab Services, GCP codelabs, or OCI labs], guiding novices step-by-step.

1. **Celebrate Progress**
   - Recognise or reward staff who complete key tasks or mini-certs (like AWS Cloud Practitioner):
     - This fosters a positive culture around skill growth.

By structuring mentorship roles, ensuring novices participate in real tasks, tracking essential skills, adding lab-based self-study, and giving recognition, you can rapidly accelerate staff readiness and consistency in cloud ops.

### We have training and mentoring programmes.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Here, your organisation invests in formal training paths or bootcamps, plus assigned mentors or peer learning groups. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Standardised Curriculum**
   - All new cloud-related hires or existing staff can follow a consistent set of modules or labs for fundamental cloud tasks.

1. **Clear Mentorship Framework**
   - Each junior or novice staff is paired with a specific mentor who checks in regularly, possibly with set learning milestones.

1. **Frequent Feedback and Peer Exchange**
   - Staff share experiences in group sessions or Slack channels dedicated to troubleshooting and tips.

If such structured programs yield consistent, secure, and cost-effective cloud practices, it meets many public sector skill-building needs. Yet you can incorporate further advanced features—like external certification readiness or specialised domain training (e.g., HPC, AI). [NCSC’s workforce security improvement guidelines](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) often advocate deeper, continuous training expansions.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to enhance structured training/mentorship:

1. **Formalise Cloud Learning Journeys**
   - e.g., for a DevOps role, define stepping stones from fundamental vendor certs to advanced specialisations:
     - AWS Solutions Architect -> SysOps -> Security, Azure Administrator -> DevOps Engineer, GCP Associate Engineer -> Professional Architect, etc.

2. **Adopt Official Vendor Training Programs**
   - Microsoft’s Enterprise Skills Initiative, AWS Skills Guild, GCP Professional Services training, or Oracle University courses:
     - This can scale up in a structured manner, referencing [NIST NICE framework for workforce skill mapping](https://csrc.nist.gov/).

3. **Establish Time Allocations**
   - Guarantee staff a certain number of hours per month for cloud labs, workshops, or self-paced learning:
     - Minimises conflicts with daily duties.

4. **Integrate Real Projects into Training**
   - Let trainees apply new skills to an actual low-risk project, e.g., a new serverless prototype or a cost optimisation analysis:
     - Encourages practical retention.

5. **Track & Reward Milestones**
   - Summarise achievements in quarterly stats: "Team X gained five new AWS Solutions Architect Associates."
   - Offer small recognition or career advancement alignment with [Civil Service success profiles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/success-profiles).

By defining clear cloud learning journeys, leveraging vendor training, scheduling dedicated study time, embedding real projects in the curriculum, and publicly recognising accomplishments, you foster a thriving environment for upskilling staff in cloud technologies.

### We offer in-house or external training to build cloud skills.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organisation provides robust training—like in-house cloud courses, external bootcamps, or vendor collaborations (AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI). You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Managed End-to-End**
   - Employees sign up for consistent programs, from beginner to advanced, with recognised certification paths.

1. **Frequent Engagement**
   - Regular classes or workshops ensure continuous skill growth, not just a one-time orientation.

1. **Positive Impact**
   - Observed improvements in staff morale, faster cloud project delivery, and fewer errors or security incidents.

This approach likely meets most skill-building needs. Nonetheless, you can push for advanced or specialised tracks (e.g., HPC, AI/ML, security) or adopt apprenticeship or "bootcamp + aftercare" models. [GOV.UK or GDS Academy courses](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) may also be integrated to reinforce public sector-specific skill sets.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** tips to refine integrated learning and development:

1. **Formal Apprenticeship or Bootcamp**
   - Partner with recognised training providers:
     - e.g., AWS re/Start, Azure Academy, GCP JumpStart, or Oracle Next Education for more in-depth coverage.
   - Ensure alignment with [NCSC or NIST cybersecurity modules](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/).

1. **Set Clear Learning Roadmaps by Function**
   - For Dev, Ops, Security, Data roles—each has curated course combos, from fundamentals to specialised advanced topics:
     - This fosters structured progression.

1. **Involve Senior Leadership Support**
   - Encourage exec sponsors to highlight success stories, attend final presentations of training cohorts, or discuss how these new skills align with departmental digital transformation goals.

1. **Combine Internal & External Teaching**
   - Use a mix of vendor trainers, in-house subject matter experts, and third-party specialists for well-rounded instruction.
   - This ensures staff see multiple perspectives.

1. **Measure ROI**
   - Track cost savings, decreased deployment times, or increased user satisfaction from cloud projects led by newly trained staff:
     - Present these metrics in leadership reviews, justifying ongoing investment.

By implementing apprenticeship or structured bootcamp approaches, organising role-specific learning paths, ensuring leadership buy-in, blending internal and external expertise, and measuring ROI, you develop a truly comprehensive and outcome-driven cloud skill development program.

### We have apprenticeship, career change and bootcamp programmes, with ongoing support.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At the highest level, your organisation runs a fully-fledged apprenticeship or bootcamp approach to converting staff with little-to-no cloud background into proficient cloud practitioners—backed by ongoing mentorship. You might see it "good enough" if:

1. **High Conversion Rates**
   - Most participants complete the program and effectively fill cloud roles.

1. **Post-Program Support**
   - After finishing, participants continue to receive coaching, refreshers, or advanced modules so their skills remain current.

1. **Strategic Workforce Planning**
   - This pipeline of new cloud talent meets growing departmental or cross-government demands, minimising reliance on external hires.

Even so, continuous improvement can come through specialised advanced tracks, collaborating with other agencies on multi-disciplinary programs, or adding recognised certifications. [NCSC guidance on building a secure workforce](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) and [NIST NICE frameworks](https://csrc.nist.gov/) reinforce deep, ongoing skill progression.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to further refine your mature apprenticeship or bootcamp program:

1. **Expand Specialist Tracks**
   - Develop advanced sub-tracks (e.g., HPC, AI/ML, Zero-Trust Security) for participants who excel at foundational cloud skills:
     - Align with vendor specialised training or NCSC/NIST security standards for deeper expertise.

1. **Coordinate Multi-department Bootcamps**
   - Collaborate with local councils, NHS, or other government bodies to form a larger talent pool:
     - Shared labs, cross-government hackathons, or combined funding can scale impact.

1. **Ensure Continuous Performance Assessments**
   - Conduct formal evaluations 6, 12, or 18 months post-bootcamp:
     - Checking advanced skill adoption, real project outcomes, and personal career growth.

1. **Public Acknowledgment & Advancement**
   - Link successful completion to career progression or pay grade enhancements, referencing civil service HR frameworks or [GOV.UK’s capability frameworks](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework).

1. **Incorporate Cost-Savings and ROI Proof**
   - Track how newly trained staff reduce external consultancy reliance, deliver projects faster, or improve security.
   - Present data to leadership, ensuring sustained or increased budgets for these programs.

By launching specialised advanced tracks, fostering cross-department collaborations, performing ongoing performance assessments, integrating real career incentives, and measuring ROI, you secure a pipeline of skilled cloud professionals well-suited to public sector demands, maintaining a resilient workforce aligned with national digital transformation objectives.

**Keep doing what you’re doing,** and consider documenting your apprenticeship or bootcamp approaches in internal blog posts or knowledge bases.
