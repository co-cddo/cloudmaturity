### **No Specific Cloud Experience Requirement:** Cloud experience is not a requirement in job postings; candidates are not specifically sought out for their cloud skills.

### **Selective Requirement for Cloud Experience:** Some job postings, particularly those in relevant areas, require candidates to have prior cloud experience.

### **Mandatory Cloud Experience for Relevant Roles:** All relevant job postings mandate cloud experience, aligning with the Digital, Data, and Technology (DDaT) role definitions.

### **Updated Role Requirements and Cloud-Focused Hiring:** In addition to requiring cloud experience for new hires, existing roles have been reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect a cloud-first IT organization.

### **Comprehensive Cloud Experience Requirement and Role Adaptation:** All job postings require cloud experience, and every existing role within the organization has been evaluated and updated where necessary to align with the needs of a cloud-first IT organization.
