### **Complete Reliance on Third Parties:** Third parties are fully responsible for all cloud work, with unrestricted access to the entire cloud infrastructure.

### **Significant Third-Party Involvement:** Third parties play a major role in delivering certain aspects of cloud work and have full access to cloud accounts.

### **Specialized Third-Party Support with Limited Access:** Third-party providers contribute specialized knowledge and maintain 'break glass' (emergency) admin access only.

### **Specialized Knowledge without Privileged Access:** Third parties provide specialized expertise but do not have any form of privileged access to cloud infrastructure.

### **Minimal or Augmentative Third-Party Role:** Third parties are either not used at all or serve purely as staff augmentation, without any privileged access or holding exclusive knowledge.
