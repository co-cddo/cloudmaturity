### **No Executive Sponsorship:** There is no executive support for cloud adoption, indicating a lack of strategic prioritization at the leadership level.

### **Senior Management Sponsorship:** The initiative is sponsored by senior management, indicating some level of support but potentially lacking full executive influence.

### **C-Level Executive Sponsorship:** One or more C-level executives sponsor the cloud adoption, demonstrating significant commitment at the highest levels of leadership.

### **Comprehensive C-Level Sponsorship with Roadmap:** Full sponsorship from C-level executives, accompanied by a shared, strategic roadmap for cloud adoption and migration.

### **C-Level Sponsorship Driving Cloud-First Culture:** Comprehensive C-level sponsorship not only provides strategic direction but also actively fosters a culture of cloud-first adoption, experimentation, and innovation throughout the organization.
