### There is no support from leadership.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your initiative to adopt 100% cloud is effectively grassroots-driven, without support from executive-level leaders (CEO, CFO, CIO, or equivalent). It might be "good enough" if:

1. **Minimal Cloud Usage**
   - The organisation is still in a very early exploration stage, so top leadership’s involvement appears non-essential.

1. **Limited or No Critical Workloads**
   - Cloud adoption does not yet impact vital citizen services or departmental mandates, so leadership sees no urgency.

1. **No Current Funding/Resourcing Requirements**
   - The teams can sustain small pilot efforts within existing budgets or staff capacity without requiring strategic direction.

However, lacking executive buy-in often results in stalled progress, inability to scale secure cloud usage, and missed opportunities for cost optimisation or digital transformation. [NCSC’s cloud security guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security) and [GOV.UK Cloud First policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy) typically advise leadership alignment to ensure secure, efficient, and future-proof adoption.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** suggestions to secure at least minimal executive sponsorship:

1. **Document Quick-Win Success Stories**
   - Show leadership how small pilots delivered cost savings, performance gains, or alignment with departmental digital goals.
   - For instance, highlight a pilot serverless function that replaced an aging on-prem script.

1. **Link Cloud Adoption to Organisational Mandates**
   - Identify how cloud usage aligns with [GOV.UK Service Manual best practices](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), or how it might enhance operational resilience per [NCSC guidelines](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/).

1. **Prepare a Simple Business Case**
   - Emphasize potential cost savings or improved agility:
     - referencing [AWS/Azure/GCP/OCI cost management calculators or TCO tools](https://aws.amazon.com/cost-management/tools/), [Azure Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/), [GCP Cost Management](https://cloud.google.com/cost-management), [OCI Cost Management](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/oci-training/), [IBM Cloud Cost Estimator](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-calculator).

1. **Request a Brief Meeting with a Senior Sponsor**
   - Secure 15-30 minutes to share pilot results or near-term opportunities:
     - Stress risk of continuing without guidance from top leadership (e.g., security gaps, budget overruns, or duplication).

1. **Offer an Executive-Level Intro**
   - Propose an hour-long cloud fundamentals overview for interested executives, possibly with vendor partner support or free training sessions.

By compiling quick-win stories, framing cloud adoption in organisational mandates, presenting a succinct business case, requesting a short meeting, and offering an executive primer, you begin building the case for at least baseline senior buy-in.

### Senior managers support the move.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

You have some backing from directors or departmental heads (below C-level) who champion the cloud initiative. This can be "good enough" if:

1. **Visible Progress**
   - The department can proceed with cloud transformations in everyday operations.
   - Key middle-management fosters departmental collaboration.

1. **Partial Funding**
   - Senior managers can authorise training or pilot spending, but might need higher sign-off for large-scale expansions.

1. **Some Accountability**
   - Senior managers track progress, but significant strategic shifts remain out of scope because top execs are not fully engaged.

Though beneficial, lacking the highest-level sponsorship might hinder cross-department alignment or hamper big-ticket modernisation. [NCSC’s supply chain and cloud security frameworks](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) often call for robust leadership direction for consistent security across the organisation.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** steps to expand from senior management to full executive endorsement:

1. **Demonstrate Departmental Wins**
   - Have senior managers publicise successful departmental cloud outcomes to executives:
     - e.g., a 20% cost reduction or improved user satisfaction in a pilot citizen-facing service.

1. **Facilitate an Exec-Level Briefing**
   - Invite the CFO or CIO to a short session with the senior manager champion:
     - Outline potential broader savings or strategic opportunities aligned with [GOV.UK digital transformation guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

1. **Align with Organisational Strategy**
   - Show how the cloud adoption aligns with published departmental or cross-government strategies, referencing [NIST risk management or NCSC operational resilience advice](https://csrc.nist.gov/).

1. **Request Executive Sponsor for Large-Scale Migrations**
   - If you plan a major migration (like HPC, AI/ML, or large data center closure), propose a "sponsor" role for a top exec:
     - Encourages them to champion budget allocations and remove cross-department barriers.

1. **Create a Vision Statement**
   - Collaborate with senior managers to draft a concise "cloud vision" for the next 1-3 years, referencing success metrics (cost, security posture, user satisfaction) to interest executives.

By showcasing departmental successes, hosting briefings with executives, integrating the initiative into overarching strategies, seeking an executive sponsor for large projects, and formalising a short vision statement, you steadily shift from partial senior sponsorship to broader top-level leadership buy-in.

### Top executives (C-level) support the move.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your cloud initiative is backed by a C-level executive (CIO, CTO, CFO, or equivalent), signaling strong leadership emphasis. It might be "good enough" if:

1. **Robust Funding & Priority**
   - The sponsor secures budgets, champions cloud at board meetings, ensuring departmental alignment.

1. **Influence Across Departments**
   - Cross-functional teams or other directors respect the executive’s authority, facilitating faster decisions.

1. **Tangible Results**
   - With high-level backing, the cloud initiative can accelerate modernisation, cost savings, or improved service delivery.

Still, to sustain this advantage, you can adopt a structured roadmap, define deeper cultural changes, or integrate advanced DevSecOps. [GOV.UK’s approach to agile/digital transformation guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and [NCSC well-architected security best practices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) can guide deeper integration.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to leverage C-level sponsorship further:

1. **Develop a Multi-Year Cloud Roadmap**
   - Collaborate with the C-level sponsor to define short, medium, and long-term goals:
     - e.g., incremental migrations, security enhancements, cost optimisation targets.

1. **Establish Clear KPIs & Milestones**
   - For example, monthly or quarterly metrics:
     - Resource usage cost, user satisfaction, time-to-deploy improvements, referencing [AWS/Azure/GCP/OCI cost management dashboards](https://aws.amazon.com/cost-management/tools/), [Azure Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/), [GCP Cost Management](https://cloud.google.com/cost-management), [OCI Cost Management](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/oci-training/).

1. **Ensure Inter-Departmental Collaboration**
   - The sponsor can champion cross-department synergy:
     - e.g., merging data streams for analytics, universal security guidelines per [NCSC cloud security or NIST risk management frameworks](https://csrc.nist.gov/).

1. **Embed Security as a First-Class Concern**
   - Since you have top-level support, request integrated DevSecOps tooling and compliance checks from day one:
     - e.g., [AWS CodeGuru or Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/), [Azure DevOps security add-ons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organisations/security/), [GCP Cloud Build scanning](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/container-scanning), [OCI security advisor services](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/oci-training/).

1. **Highlight Public Sector Success**
   - Encourage your sponsor to share wins at internal leadership summits or cross-gov conferences, fostering further executive-level peer collaboration.

By crafting a multi-year roadmap, specifying meaningful KPIs, promoting cross-department synergy, embedding robust security from the start, and publicising achievements, you realise the full benefits of C-level sponsorship—driving cohesive, secure, and strategic cloud adoption.

### Top executives support the move and there is a clear plan.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Here, your cloud initiative enjoys comprehensive executive support, with a well-defined plan across multiple departments or services. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Clear Multi-Department Involvement**
   - The entire leadership team endorses a unified cloud strategy, establishing integrated goals.

1. **Detailed Migration & Transformation Plan**
   - A collaborative roadmap outlines which apps or services move first, timelines for HPC or AI expansions, or how to integrate new DevOps pipelines.

1. **Measured Organisational Impact**
   - You can show cost savings, improved reliability, or user satisfaction correlating with the roadmap’s progress.

Though advanced, you can refine metrics, extend advanced HPC/AI usage, or further embed a "cloud-first" ethos across every level of staff. [NCSC’s "cloud first" security posture advice](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) and [GOV.UK digital transformation frameworks](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) remain relevant for continuous improvement.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to strengthen a comprehensive C-level sponsorship with a strategic roadmap:

1. **Involve Staff in Roadmap Updates**
   - Host quarterly open sessions where devs, ops, or security can give feedback on the strategic plan:
     - Encourages buy-in and surfaces practical constraints.

1. **Institute a Cloud Steering Committee**
   - Form a cross-functional group with representation from finance, HR, security, architecture, and user departments:
     - They meet regularly to track progress, share challenges, and drive adjustments in the roadmap.

1. **Focus on Advanced Migrations or Services**
   - Tackle HPC, advanced analytics, or AI/ML adoption:
     - Possibly referencing HPC or ML best practices from [AWS HPC Competency](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/), [Azure HPC](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing/azure-fast-track-solutions), [GCP AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform), [OCI HPC solutions](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/oci-training/).

1. **Integrate Multi-Cloud or Hybrid Considerations**
   - If the roadmap suggests multi-cloud or a hybrid approach:
     - Align with [NCSC multi-cloud security best practices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) or [NIST guidelines on hybrid architecture risk management](https://csrc.nist.gov/).

1. **Publish Success Metrics**
   - Show top-level achievements or cost savings in staff newsletters or a leadership dashboard:
     - Reinforces organisational momentum for the roadmap.

By updating the roadmap collaboratively, establishing a cloud steering committee, venturing into advanced HPC/AI/ML, acknowledging multi-cloud/hybrid scenarios, and publicising success metrics, you deepen the synergy and accountability behind your cloud adoption plan—leading to dynamic, well-supported progress.

### Top executives lead a cloud-first culture and push for innovation.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this ultimate stage, your organisation’s top leadership proactively cultivates a "cloud-first" mindset, championing experimentation and innovation. You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Embedded Cloud Thinking**
   - Staff across all levels default to considering cloud solutions first for new projects, referencing [GOV.UK Cloud First policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy).

1. **High Experimentation & Safe Fail**
   - DevSecOps teams conduct frequent PoCs, quickly pivoting from unsuccessful trials with minimal friction or blame.

1. **Relentless Focus on Value & Security**
   - The culture merges cost-awareness, user-centric design, and [NCSC security best practices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) at every step.

1. **Confidence and Autonomy**
   - Teams can easily spin up new resources or adopt new services within guardrails—thanks to strong governance, automated compliance checks, and constant exec support.

Though already advanced, you can still refine cross-department synergy, adopt emerging HPC/AI capabilities, or serve as a best-practice model for other public sector organisations. Continuous improvement aligns with [NIST cybersecurity frameworks](https://csrc.nist.gov/) and frequent updates to [NCSC secure cloud guidelines](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/).

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to continuously strengthen a cloud-first culture under comprehensive C-level sponsorship:

1. **Scale Innovation Hubs**
   - If you have a center of excellence or an innovation lab, extend its scope to HPC, AI/ML, IoT, or advanced HPC:
     - e.g., adopt HPC solutions from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing/azure-fast-track-solutions), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform), [OCI](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/oci-training/), incorporating domain specialists.

1. **Open Source & Share**
   - Encourage teams to open-source relevant code or automation, participating in cross-government communities:
     - fosters broader knowledge exchange, referencing [GOV.UK open source policy](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/).

1. **Enable Real-Time Security & Compliance**
   - Consolidate compliance with [AWS Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/), [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview), [GCP Organisation Policy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organisation-policy/overview), [OCI Security Zones](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/oci-training/) for frictionless guardrails:
     - ensures staff can spin up resources rapidly without jeopardising security or policy compliance.

1. **Track Cloud Maturity Beyond Tech**
   - Evaluate cultural aspects: e.g., dev empowerment, cost accountability, user feedback loops.
   - Revisit or revise success criteria every 6-12 months.

1. **Recognise and Reward Cloud Champions**
   - Publicly celebrate individuals or squads who pioneer new solutions, demonstrate cost savings, or deliver advanced workloads in HPC or serverless.

By scaling innovation hubs, open-sourcing solutions, implementing real-time compliance guardrails, tracking maturity across cultural dimensions, and publicly recognising cloud champions, you cement a thriving, cloud-first culture that embraces experimentation, security, and strategic public sector outcomes.

**Keep doing what you’re doing,** and consider publishing blog posts or opening pull requests to share your experiences in fostering a cloud-first mindset under strong executive sponsorship. This helps others in the UK public sector replicate or learn from your advanced leadership-driven cloud transformation.
