## How are technology selections made for new projects within your organization?[radios] =

() **Ad-Hoc and Independent Selections:** Each project independently selects technologies, leading to a diverse and often incompatible technology estate.
() **Uniform Technology Mandate:** Technology choices are highly regulated, with a uniform, organization-wide technology stack that all projects must adhere to.
() **Guided by Outdated Resources:** A technology radar and some documented patterns exist, but they are outdated and not widely regarded as useful or relevant.
() **Current and Maintained Guidance:** A regularly updated technology radar, along with current documentation and patterns, covers a wide range of use cases and is actively used for guidance.
() **Collaborative and Evolving Ecosystem:** Regular show-and-tell sessions and collaboration with existing teams are encouraged. There's a strong emphasis on reusing and extending existing solutions, alongside rewarding innovation and experimentation.

## What is your approach to managing data retention within your organization?[radios] =

() **Organization-Level Policy Awareness:** Data retention policies are defined at the organization level, and all projects/programs are aware of their specific responsibilities.
() **Compliance Attestation by Projects:** Projects and programs are not only aware but also required to formally attest their compliance with the data retention policies.
() **Regular Audits and Reviews:** Data retention practices are periodically audited and reviewed for compliance, with findings addressed through action plans.
() **Inclusion in Risk Management:** Edge cases and exceptions in data retention are specifically identified and managed within the organization’s risk register.
() **Automated Enforcement with Cloud Tools:** Data retention is actively monitored and enforced using native cloud services and tools, ensuring adherence to policies through automation.

## How does your organization identify, classify, and manage its data storage and usage?[radios] =

() **Decentralized and Ad Hoc Management:** Data management is largely uncoordinated and informal, with limited organizational oversight of data storage locations and types.
() **Team-Based Documentation and Manual Policy Adherence:** Each team documents the data they handle, including its schema and sensitivity. Compliance with organizational data policies is managed manually by individual teams.
() **Inventoried and Classified Data:** An inventory of data, created manually or via scanning tools, exists. Data is classified by type (e.g., PII, card data), sensitivity, and regulatory requirements (e.g., retention, location).
() **Reviewed and Partially Documented Data Understanding:** There’s a comprehensive understanding of data location, classification, and sensitivity, with regular compliance reviews. Data lineage is generally understood but not consistently documented.
() **Advanced Data Catalog and Lineage Tracking:** A detailed data catalog exists, encompassing data types and metadata. It includes a user-friendly glossary, quality metrics, use cases, and thorough tracking of data lineage.

## What is your primary method for provisioning cloud services?[radios] =

() **Manual or Imperative Provisioning:** Cloud services are primarily provisioned manually through consoles, portals, CLI, or other tools, without significant automation.
() **Limited Scripting with No Standards:** Provisioning involves some scripting, but there are no formal standards or consistency across project teams.
() **Partial Declarative Automation:** Declarative automation is used for provisioning some cloud services across their lifecycle, but this practice is not uniform across all teams.
() **Widespread Use of Declarative Automation:** Most project teams employ declarative automation for cloud service provisioning, indicating a higher level of maturity in automation practices.
() **Mandatory Declarative Automation via CI/CD:** Declarative automation is mandated for provisioning all production services, and it is exclusively executed through Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## What characterizes the majority of your current technology stack?[radios] =

() **Monolithic Applications with Wide Technology Stack:** The predominant architecture is monolithic, with applications deployed as single, indivisible units encompassing a wide range of technologies.
() **Modular but Not Independently Deployable:** Applications are broken down into modules, offering greater development flexibility, yet these modules are not deployable as independent components.
() **Modularized and Individually Deployable Components:** Applications are structured into self-contained, individually deployable components. However, significant interdependencies add complexity to testing.
() **Mostly Independent Deployment with Some Monoliths:** While most application components are independently deployable and testable, a few core system components still rely on a monolithic architecture.
() **Fully Component-Based Modular Architecture:** The technology stack consistently utilizes a component-based modular approach. All components are independently testable and deployable, free from monolithic stack dependencies.

## How does your organization handle the creation and storage of build artifacts?[radios] =

() **Ad-Hoc or Non-Existent Artifact Management:** Build artifacts are not systematically managed; code and configurations are often edited live on servers.
() **Environment-Specific Rebuilds:** Artifacts are rebuilt in each environment, leading to potential inconsistencies and inefficiencies.
() **Basic Artifact Storage with Version Control:** Build artifacts are stored, possibly with version control, but without strong emphasis on immutability or security measures.
() **Pinned Dependencies with Cryptographic Verification:** All dependencies in build artifacts are tightly pinned to specific versions, with cryptographic signing or hashes to ensure integrity.
() **Immutable, Signed Artifacts with Audit-Ready Storage:** Immutable build artifacts are created and cryptographically signed, especially for production. All artifacts are stored in immutable storage for a defined period for audit purposes, with a clear process to recreate environments for thorough audits or criminal investigations.

## How is version control and branch strategy implemented in your organization?[radios] =

() **Limited Version Control Usage:** Version control is used minimally, indicating a lack of robust processes for managing code changes and history.
() **Custom, Unconventional Branch Strategy:** An invented branch strategy is in use, not aligning with standard methodologies and potentially leading to confusion or inefficiencies.
() **Adapted Recognized Branch Strategy:** The organization adapts a recognized branch strategy (like GitFlow or GitHubFlow), tailoring it to specific needs while maintaining some standard practices.
() **Textbook Implementation of a recognized branch strategy:** The organization adheres strictly to a model such as GitFlow, a recognized branch strategy suitable for managing complex development processes.
() **Textbook Implementation of a streamlined branch strategy:** The organization follows a streamlined branch strategy ideal for continuous delivery and simplified collaboration such as GitHubFlow precisely.

## How does your organization manage its cloud environment?[radios] =

() **Manual Click-Ops as Required:** Cloud management is performed manually as and when needed, without any systematic approach or automation.
() **Documented Manual Click-Ops:** Manual click-ops are used, but steps are documented. Operations may be tested in a similarly maintained non-production environment, though discrepancies likely exist between environments.
() **Semi-Automated with Some Scripting:** Some aspects of cloud management are automated, possibly through scripting, but manual interventions are still common for complex tasks or configurations.
() **Highly Automated with Standardized Processes:** Cloud management is largely automated with standardized processes across environments. Regular reviews and updates are made to ensure alignment with best practices.
() **Fully Managed by Declarative Code with Drift Detection:** Cloud management is fully automated and managed by declarative code. Continual automated drift detection is in place, with alerts for any deviations treated as significant incidents.

## How does your organization manage and update access policies and controls, and how are these changes communicated?[radios] =

() **Ad-Hoc Policy Management and Inconsistent Application:** Policies are not formally defined; decisions are based on individual opinion or past experience. Policies are not published, access controls are inconsistently applied, and exemptions are often granted without follow-up.
() **Basic Policy Documentation with Some Communication:** Access policies are documented, but updates and their communication are irregular. There is a lack of a systematic approach to applying and communicating policy changes.
() **Regular Policy Reviews with Formal Communication Processes:** Policies are regularly reviewed and updated, with formal processes for communicating changes to relevant stakeholders, though the process may not be fully transparent or collaborative.
() **Integrated Policy Management with Stakeholder Engagement:** Policy updates are managed through an integrated process involving key stakeholders. Changes are communicated effectively, ensuring clear understanding across the organization.
() **Policy as Code with Transparent, Collaborative Updates:** Policy intent and implementation are maintained in version control, accessible to all. The process for proposing updates is clear and well-understood, allowing for regular, transparent updates akin to software releases. Policies have testable side effects, ensuring clarity and comprehension.

## TODO:How does your organization apply and enforce policies?[radios] =
() **no application**
() **no enforcement**
() **process only**
() **comprehensive process, limited technical control**
() **comprehensive process, comprehensive technical controls executed at all stages**

## How does the shared responsibility model influence your organization's approach to cloud consumption?[radios] =

() **Minimal Consideration of Shared Responsibility:** The shared responsibility model is not a primary factor in cloud consumption decisions, often leading to misunderstandings or gaps in responsibility.
() **Basic Awareness of Shared Responsibilities:** There is a basic understanding of the model, but it's not systematically applied or deeply understood across the organization.
() **Informed Decision-Making Based on Shared Responsibilities:** Decisions regarding cloud consumption are informed by the shared responsibility model, ensuring a clearer understanding of the division of responsibilities.
() **Strategic Integration of Shared Responsibility in Cloud Planning:** The shared responsibility model is strategically integrated into cloud consumption planning, with regular assessments to ensure responsibilities are well-managed. Decisions to retain responsibilities in house are documented and shared with the cloud vendor.
() **Critical Factor in Cloud Consumption and Value Assessment:** The shared responsibility model is central to all decision-making regarding cloud consumption. It's regularly revisited to assess value for money and optimize the division of responsibilities with the cloud vendor.
