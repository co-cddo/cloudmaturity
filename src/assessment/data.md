## What is your approach to managing data retention within your organization?[radios] =

() **Organization-Level Policy Awareness:** Data retention policies are defined at the organization level, and all projects/programs are aware of their specific responsibilities.
() **Compliance Attestation by Projects:** Projects and programs are not only aware but also required to formally attest their compliance with the data retention policies.
() **Regular Audits and Reviews:** Data retention practices are periodically audited and reviewed for compliance, with findings addressed through action plans.
() **Inclusion in Risk Management:** Edge cases and exceptions in data retention are specifically identified and managed within the organization’s risk register.
() **Automated Enforcement with Cloud Tools:** Data retention is actively monitored and enforced using native cloud services and tools, ensuring adherence to policies through automation.

## How does your organization identify, classify, and manage its data storage and usage?[radios] =

() **Decentralized and Ad Hoc Management:** Data management is largely uncoordinated and informal, with limited organizational oversight of data storage locations and types.
() **Team-Based Documentation and Manual Policy Adherence:** Each team documents the data they handle, including its schema and sensitivity. Compliance with organizational data policies is managed manually by individual teams.
() **Inventoried and Classified Data:** An inventory of data, created manually or via scanning tools, exists. Data is classified by type (e.g., PII, card data), sensitivity, and regulatory requirements (e.g., retention, location).
() **Reviewed and Partially Documented Data Understanding:** There’s a comprehensive understanding of data location, classification, and sensitivity, with regular compliance reviews. Data lineage is generally understood but not consistently documented.
() **Advanced Data Catalog and Lineage Tracking:** A detailed data catalog exists, encompassing data types and metadata. It includes a user-friendly glossary, quality metrics, use cases, and thorough tracking of data lineage.
