## How does your organization identify, classify, and manage its data storage and usage?[radios] =

() **Decentralized and Ad Hoc Management:** Data management is largely uncoordinated and informal, with limited organizational oversight of data storage locations and types.
() **Team-Based Documentation and Manual Policy Adherence:** Each team documents the data they handle, including its schema and sensitivity. Compliance with organizational data policies is managed manually by individual teams.
() **Inventoried and Classified Data:** An inventory of data, created manually or via scanning tools, exists. Data is classified by type (e.g., PII, card data), sensitivity, and regulatory requirements (e.g., retention, location).
() **Reviewed and Partially Documented Data Understanding:** Thereâ€™s a comprehensive understanding of data location, classification, and sensitivity, with regular compliance reviews. Data lineage is generally understood but not consistently documented.
() **Advanced Data Catalog and Lineage Tracking:** A detailed data catalog exists, encompassing data types and metadata. It includes a user-friendly glossary, quality metrics, use cases, and thorough tracking of data lineage.
