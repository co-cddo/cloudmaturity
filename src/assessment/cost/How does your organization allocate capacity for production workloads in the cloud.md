### **Peak Provisioning:** Capacity is typically provisioned based on peak usage estimates, potentially leading to underutilization during off-peak times.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

When an organization provisions capacity solely based on the highest possible load (peak usage), it generally results in:

1. **High Reliance on Worst-Case Scenarios**

   - You assume your daily or seasonal peak might occur at any time, so you allocate enough VMs, containers, or resources to handle that load continuously.
   - This can be seen as "good enough" if your traffic is extremely spiky, mission-critical, or your downtime tolerance is near zero.

1. **Predictable But Potentially Wasteful Costs**

   - By maintaining peak capacity around the clock, your spend is predictable, but you may overpay substantially during off-peak hours.
   - This might be acceptable if your budget is not severely constrained or if your leadership prioritizes simplicity over optimization.

1. **Minimal Operational Complexity**

   - No advanced autoscaling or reconfiguration scripts are needed, as you do not scale up or down dynamically.
   - For teams with limited cloud or DevOps expertise, "peak provisioning" might be temporarily "good enough."

1. **Compliance or Regulatory Factors**
   - Certain government services may face strict requirements that demand consistent capacity. If scaling or re-provisioning poses risk to meeting an SLA, you may choose to keep peak capacity as a safer option.

You might find "Peak Provisioning" still acceptable if cost oversight is low, your risk threshold is minimal, and you prefer operational simplicity. However, with public sector budgets under increasing scrutiny and user load patterns often varying significantly, this approach often wastes resources—both financial and environmental.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** steps to reduce waste and move beyond provisioning for the extreme peak:

1. **Implement Resource Monitoring and Basic Analytics**

   - Gather usage metrics to understand actual peaks, off-peak times, and daily/weekly cycles:
     - [AWS CloudWatch metrics + AWS Cost Explorer to see usage vs. cost patterns](https://TODO)
     - [Azure Monitor + Azure Cost Management for hourly/daily usage trends](https://TODO)
     - [GCP Monitoring + GCP Billing reports (BigQuery export for deeper analysis)](https://TODO)
     - [OCI Monitoring + OCI Cost Analysis for instance-level metrics](https://TODO)
   - Share this data with stakeholders to highlight the discrepancy between peak vs. average usage.

1. **Pilot Scheduled Shutdowns for Non-Critical Systems**

   - Identify dev/test environments or batch-processing servers that don’t need 24/7 availability:
     - Use [AWS Instance Scheduler Solution](https://TODO) or [Azure Automation Start/Stop VMs](https://TODO)
     - [GCP Cloud Scheduler with compute stop scripts](https://TODO)
     - [OCI Scheduled Autoscaling or Resource Scheduler scripts](https://TODO)
   - This is a quick win to demonstrate immediate cost savings without impacting production.

1. **Explore Simple Autoscaling Solutions**

   - Even if you continue peak provisioning for mission-critical workloads, pick a smaller or non-critical service to test autoscaling:
     - [AWS Auto Scaling Groups – basic CPU-based triggers](https://TODO)
     - [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets – scale by CPU or memory usage](https://TODO)
     - [GCP Managed Instance Groups – autoscale based on utilization thresholds](https://TODO)
     - [OCI Instance Pool Autoscaling – CPU or custom metrics triggers](https://TODO)

1. **Review Reserved or Discounted Pricing**

   - If you must maintain consistently high capacity, consider vendor discount programs to reduce per-hour cost:
     - [AWS Savings Plans or Reserved Instances](https://TODO)
     - [Azure Reservations for VMs and databases](https://TODO)
     - [GCP Committed Use Discounts](https://TODO)
     - [OCI Annual Flex or Reserved Capacity offers](https://TODO)
   - This won’t eliminate over-provisioning but can soften the budget impact.

1. **Engage Leadership on the Financial and Sustainability Benefits**
   - Present how on-demand autoscaling or even basic scheduling can reduce overhead and potentially improve your service’s environmental footprint.
   - Link these improvements to departmental net-zero or cost reduction goals, highlighting easy wins.

Through monitoring, scheduling, basic autoscaling pilots, and potential reserved capacity, you can move away from static peak provisioning. This approach preserves reliability while unlocking efficiency gains—an important step in balancing cost, compliance, and performance goals in the UK public sector.

### **Manual Scaling Based on Average Consumption:** Capacity is provisioned for average usage, with manual scaling adjustments made seasonally or as needed.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

This stage represents an improvement over peak provisioning: you size your environment around typical usage rather than the maximum. You might see this as "good enough" if:

1. **Periodic But Manageable Traffic Patterns**

   - You may only observe seasonal spikes (e.g., monthly end-of-period reporting, yearly enrollments, etc.). Manually scaling before known events could be sufficient.
   - The overhead of full autoscaling might not seem worthwhile if spikes are infrequent and predictable.

1. **Comfortable Manual Operations**

   - You have a change-management process that can quickly add or remove capacity on a known schedule (e.g., scaling up ahead of local council tax billing cycles).
   - If your staff can handle these tasks promptly, the organization might see no urgency in adopting automated approaches.

1. **Budgets and Costs Partially Optimized**

   - By aligning capacity to average usage (rather than peak), you reduce some waste. You might see moderate cost savings compared to peak provisioning.
   - The cost overhead from less frequent or smaller over-provisioning might be tolerable.

1. **Stable or Slow-Growing Environments**
   - If your cloud usage is not rapidly increasing, a manual approach might not yet lead to major inefficiencies.
   - You have limited real-time or unpredictable usage surges.

That said, manual scaling can become a bottleneck if usage unexpectedly grows or if multiple applications need frequent changes. The risk is human error (forgetting to scale back down), delayed response to traffic spikes, or missed budget opportunities.

#### **How to do better**

Here are **rapidly actionable** steps to evolve from manual seasonal scaling to a more automated, responsive model:

1. **Automate the Manual Steps You Already Do**

   - If you anticipate seasonal peaks (e.g., quarterly public reporting load), replace the manual process with scheduled scripts:
     - [AWS EC2 Start/Stop scheduling or Step Functions orchestration](https://TODO)
     - [Azure Runbooks in Automation Accounts for seasonal scale-ups/scale-downs](https://TODO)
     - [GCP Cloud Scheduler with Terraform or instance group scripts](https://TODO)
     - [OCI Resource Manager stacks + Cron tasks for scaling events](https://TODO)
   - This prevents staff from forgetting or missing the scale-down step.

1. **Identify and Enforce "Scale-Back" Windows**

   - Even if you scale up for busy times, ensure you have a defined "sunset" for increased capacity:
     - Configure an autoscaling group or scale set to revert to default size after the peak.
     - Set reminders or triggers to ensure you don’t pay for extra capacity indefinitely.

1. **Introduce Autoscaling on a Limited Component**

   - Choose a module that frequently experiences load variations within a day or week—perhaps a web front-end for a public information portal:
     - [AWS Auto Scaling Groups with CPU-based or request-based triggers for that service](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets or AKS cluster autoscaler for the busiest microservice](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Managed Instance Groups with load-based autoscaling for the front end](https://TODO).
     - [OCI Instance Pool or OKE autoscaler for a specific containerized service](https://TODO).
   - This "partial automation" can show immediate benefits, encouraging broader adoption.

1. **Consider Serverless for Spiky Components**

   - If certain tasks run sporadically (e.g., monthly data transformation or PDF generation), investigate moving them to event-driven or serverless solutions:
     - [AWS Lambda or Fargate tasks triggered by events](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or Container Apps for scheduled tasks](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Cloud Functions or Cloud Run for ephemeral jobs](https://TODO).
     - [OCI Functions for on-demand workloads](https://TODO).
   - This eliminates the need to manually adjust VMs for these short bursts.

1. **Monitor and Alert on Usage Deviations**
   - Use cost and performance alerts to catch unexpected surges or protracted idle resources:
     - [AWS Budgets alerts or CloudWatch anomaly detection metrics](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Monitor alerts, including cost anomalies in Cost Management](https://TODO).
     - [GCP cost anomalies with Billing Budgets + pub/sub notifications](https://TODO).
     - [OCI cost budgeting, usage alarms, and notifications](https://TODO).
   - Alerts will help you act faster than typical manual cycles.

By automating your manual scaling processes, exploring partial autoscaling, and shifting spiky tasks to serverless, you unlock more agility and cost efficiency. This approach helps ensure you’re not left scrambling if usage deviates from seasonal patterns.

### **Basic Autoscaling for Certain Components:** Autoscaling is enabled for some cloud components, primarily based on simple capacity or utilization metrics.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this stage, you’ve moved beyond purely manual methods: some of your workloads automatically scale in or out when CPU, memory, or queue depth crosses a threshold. This can be "good enough" if:

1. **Limited Service Scope**

   - You have identified a few critical or high-variance components (e.g., your front-end web tier) that benefit significantly from autoscaling.
   - Remaining workloads may be stable or less likely to see large traffic swings.

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**

   - You deliberately keep autoscaling rules straightforward (e.g., CPU > 70% for 5 minutes) to avoid over-engineering.
   - This might meet departmental objectives, provided the load pattern doesn’t vary unpredictably.

1. **Reduced Manual Overhead**

   - Thanks to autoscaling on certain components, you rarely intervene during typical usage spikes.
   - You still handle major events or seasonal shifts manually, but day-to-day usage is more stable.

1. **Partially Controlled Costs**
   - Because your most dynamic workloads scale automatically, you see fewer cost overruns from over-provisioning.
   - You still might maintain some underutilized capacity for other components, but it’s acceptable given your risk appetite.

If your environment only sees moderate changes in demand and leadership doesn’t demand full elasticity, "Basic Autoscaling for Certain Components" can suffice. However, if your user base or usage patterns expand, or if you aim for deeper cost optimization, you could unify autoscaling across more workloads and utilize advanced triggers.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **actionable** ways to upgrade from basic autoscaling:

1. **Broaden Autoscaling Coverage**

   - Extend autoscaling to more workloads:
     - [AWS: Use EC2 Auto Scaling on multiple groups, ECS Service auto-scaling for container tasks, or RDS auto-scaling (e.g., Aurora Auto Scaling)](https://TODO).
     - [Azure: VM Scale Sets for more services, or container-based scaling in AKS, or Azure SQL Elastic Pool for DB capacity](https://TODO).
     - [GCP: Expand MIG-based autoscaling across more zones, or use Cloud SQL instance autoscaling features (where available)](https://TODO).
     - [OCI: Use instance pool autoscaling for additional workloads, or Database Cloud Service auto-scaling options](https://TODO).
   - Gradually bring more of your app’s microservices into the autoscaling fold.

1. **Incorporate More Granular Metrics**

   - Move beyond simple CPU-based thresholds to handle memory usage, disk I/O, or application-level concurrency:
     - [AWS CloudWatch custom metrics or AWS ALB request count for autoscaling triggers](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Monitor custom metrics (e.g., queue length, HTTP request rate), feeding into Scale Sets or AKS HPA](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Stackdriver custom metrics or request-based autoscaling in GKE or Cloud Run](https://TODO).
     - [OCI: Custom metrics in Monitoring service for queue depth, memory usage, or user concurrency triggers](https://TODO).

1. **Implement Dynamic, Scheduled, or Predictive Scaling**

   - If you know certain patterns (lunchtime peaks, weekend dips), add scheduled scaling to your existing autoscaling:
     - [AWS Auto Scaling scheduled actions (e.g., scale up at 08:00, down at 20:00)](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Scale Sets with scheduled times or DevOps pipelines that adjust capacity automatically](https://TODO).
     - [GCP’s managed instance group schedule hooks or scripts triggered by Cloud Scheduler](https://TODO).
     - [OCI instance pools scheduling or using Oracle Functions for timed scale events](https://TODO).
   - Predictive scaling (if available) can preempt spikes by analyzing historical data.

1. **Enhance Observability to Validate Autoscaling Efficacy**

   - Instrument your autoscaling events and track them:
     - Dashboard real-time CPU, memory, queue metrics alongside scaling events.
     - Check if scaling events come too late (CPU near 100% for extended periods) or if you over-scale (frequent scale-in events).
   - Tools:
     - [AWS X-Ray or AWS CloudWatch dashboards with scaling event logs](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Monitor + App Insights to correlate scaling with performance metrics](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Cloud Operations suite (Logging, Monitoring, Tracing) to analyze MIG or Cloud Run autoscaling events](https://TODO).
     - [OCI Logging and Observability platform showing instance pool scale in/out events over time](https://TODO).

1. **Adopt Spot/Preemptible Instances for Autoscaled Non-Critical Workloads**
   - You can further optimize cost if your scaled-out capacity uses cheaper spot/preemptible VMs:
     - [AWS EC2 Spot Instances within an Auto Scaling Group](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Spot VMs for scale sets in non-critical workloads](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Preemptible VMs in managed instance groups](https://TODO).
     - [OCI Preemptible Instances for batch or flexible tasks](https://TODO).

By broadening autoscaling across more components, incorporating richer metrics, scheduling, and advanced cost strategies like spot instances, you transform your "basic" scaling approach into a more agile, cost-effective solution. Over time, these steps foster robust, automated resource management across your entire environment.

### **Widespread Autoscaling with Basic Metrics:** Autoscaling is a common practice, although it mainly utilizes basic metrics, with limited use of log or application-specific metrics.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

You’ve expanded autoscaling across many workloads: from front-end services to internal APIs, possibly including some data processing components. However, you’re mostly using CPU, memory, or standard throughput metrics as triggers. This can be "good enough" if:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**

   - Most of your core applications scale automatically as demand changes. Manual interventions are rare and usually revolve around unusual events or big product launches.

1. **Efficient Day-to-Day Operations**

   - Cost and capacity usage are largely optimized since few resources remain significantly underutilized or idle.
   - Staff seldom worry about reconfiguring capacity for typical fluctuations.

1. **Satisfactory Performance**

   - Using basic metrics (CPU, memory) covers typical load patterns adequately.
   - The risk of slower scale-up in more complex scenarios (like surges in queue lengths or specific user transactions) might be acceptable.

1. **Stable or Predictable Load Growth**
   - Even with widespread autoscaling, if your usage grows in somewhat predictable increments, basic triggers might suffice.
   - You rarely need to investigate advanced logs or correlation with end-user response times to refine scaling.

If your service-level objectives (SLOs) and budgets remain met with these simpler triggers, you may be comfortable. However, more advanced autoscaling can yield better responsiveness for spiky or complex applications that rely heavily on queue lengths, user concurrency, or custom application metrics (e.g., transactions per second, memory leaks, etc.).

#### **How to do better**

Here are **actionable** ways to refine your widespread autoscaling strategy to handle more nuanced workloads:

1. **Adopt Application-Level or Log-Based Metrics**

   - Move beyond CPU/memory to incorporate transaction rates, request latency, or user concurrency:
     - [AWS CloudWatch custom metrics from application logs, or real-time log analysis with Kinesis + Lambda for dynamic scaling triggers](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Monitor’s Application Insights usage data or custom logs for scaling signals in AKS or VM Scale Sets](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Logging + Cloud Monitoring custom metrics for scaling GCE or GKE based on request count, latency, or queue depth](https://TODO).
     - [OCI Monitoring custom metrics derived from application logs (via OCI Logging Analytics) to trigger autoscaling events](https://TODO).

1. **Introduce Multi-Metric Policies**

   - Instead of a single threshold, combine metrics. For instance:
     - Scale up if CPU > 70% AND average request latency > 300ms.
     - This ensures you only scale when both resource utilization and user experience degrade, reducing false positives or unneeded expansions.

1. **Implement Predictive or Machine Learning–Driven Autoscaling**

   - Some providers offer advanced or predictive scaling:
     - [AWS Auto Scaling with Predictive Scaling (leveraging historical data)](https://TODO).
     - [Azure ML forecasting integrated with scale sets or AKS HPA (custom solution or preview features)](https://TODO).
     - [GCP advanced forecasting with time-series analysis in Cloud Monitoring or custom ML models triggering Cloud Run container scaling](https://TODO).
     - [OCI integration with custom Oracle Analytics Cloud or ML-based forecasting for scale in/out events](https://TODO).
   - This approach anticipates demand spikes before CPU metrics react.

1. **Correlate Autoscaling with End-User Experience**

   - If your primary metric is user satisfaction or page load time, link scaling logic more directly to these user-centric metrics:
     - [AWS ALB or NLB target response times fed into CloudWatch metrics](https://TODO).
     - [Azure App Service or Azure Front Door logs analyzing end-to-end latency, feeding into scale triggers](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Cloud Load Balancing logs and SLO-based triggers integrated with GKE or MIG autoscaling](https://TODO).
     - [OCI LB health checks or custom application pings that feed into autoscaling triggers](https://TODO).

1. **Refine Scaling Cooldowns and Timers**
   - Tweak scale-up and scale-down intervals to avoid thrashing:
     - A short scale-up delay can address spikes quickly.
     - A slightly longer scale-down delay prevents abrupt resource removals when a short spike recedes.
   - Evaluate your autoscaling policy settings monthly to align with evolving traffic patterns.

By incorporating more sophisticated application or log-based metrics, predictive scaling, and user-centric triggers, you ensure capacity aligns closely with real workloads. This approach elevates your autoscaling from a broad CPU/memory-based strategy to a finely tuned system that balances user experience, performance, and cost efficiency.

### **Advanced Autoscaling Using Detailed Metrics:** Autoscaling is ubiquitously used, based on sophisticated log or application metrics, allowing for highly responsive and efficient capacity allocation.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

In this final, most mature stage, your organization applies advanced autoscaling across practically every production workload. Detailed logs, queue depths, user concurrency, or response times drive scaling decisions. This likely means:

1. **Holistic Observability and Telemetry**

   - You collect and analyze logs, metrics, and traces in near real-time, correlating them to auto-scale events.
   - Teams have dashboards that reflect business-level metrics (e.g., transactions processed, citizen requests served) to trigger expansions or contractions.

1. **Proactive or Predictive Scaling**

   - You anticipate traffic spikes based on historical data or usage trends (like major public announcements, election result postings, etc.).
   - Scale actions happen before a noticeable performance drop, offering a seamless user experience.

1. **Minimal Human Intervention**

   - Manual resizing is rare, reserved for extraordinary circumstances (e.g., emergent security patches, new application deployments).
   - Staff focus on refining autoscaling policies, not reacting to capacity emergencies.

1. **Cost-Optimized and Performance-Savvy**
   - Because you rarely over-provision for extended periods, your budget usage remains tightly aligned with actual needs.
   - End-users or citizens experience consistently fast response times due to prompt scale-outs.

If you find that your applications handle usage spikes gracefully, cost anomalies are rare, and advanced metrics keep everything stable, you have likely achieved an advanced autoscaling posture. Nevertheless, with the rapid evolution of cloud services, there are always methods to iterate and improve.

#### **How to do better**

Even at the top level, you can refine and push boundaries further:

1. **Adopt More Granular "Distributed SLO" Metrics**

   - Evaluate each microservice’s service-level objectives (SLOs), e.g., 99th-percentile latency under 400ms.
   - Use [AWS SLO-based alerts with custom CloudWatch metrics or "ServiceLens" integration](https://TODO), [Azure Monitor SLO tracking with Application Insights or Service Map](https://TODO), [GCP SLO dashboards (Cloud Operations suite)](https://TODO), [OCI Observability SLO definitions with Logging Analytics correlation](https://TODO) to guide scaling decisions.
   - The better you measure how each component meets its SLO, the more precisely you can scale for performance vs. cost.

1. **Experiment with Multi-Provider or Hybrid Autoscaling**

   - If policy allows, or your architecture is containerized, test the feasibility of bursting into another region or cloud for capacity:
     - [AWS EKS + Azure AKS cross-cloud bursting or cluster federation](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Anthos bridging on-prem or other clouds for large spikes](https://TODO).
     - [OCI multi-region or hybrid partner solutions for HPC or large ephemeral usage](https://TODO).
   - This approach is advanced but can further optimize resilience and cost across providers.

1. **Integrate with Detailed Cost Allocation & Forecasting**

   - Combine real-time scale data with cost forecasting models:
     - [AWS Budgets with advanced forecasting, or AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for unplanned scale-ups](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Cost Management budgets + ML forecasting in Power BI integrations](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Budgets & cost predictions in the Billing console, BigQuery analysis for scale patterns vs. spend](https://TODO).
     - [OCI Cost Analysis with usage forecasting and custom alerts for spike detection](https://TODO).
   - This ensures you can quickly investigate if an unusual surge in scaling leads to unapproved budget expansions.

1. **Leverage AI/ML for Real-Time Scaling Decisions**

   - Deploy advanced ML models that continuously adapt scaling triggers based on anomaly detection in logs or usage patterns.
   - Tools or patterns:
     - [AWS Lookout for Metrics integrated with AWS Lambda to adjust scaling groups in real-time](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Cognitive Services or ML pipelines that feed insights to an auto-scaling script in AKS or Scale Sets](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Vertex AI or Dataflow pipelines analyzing streaming logs to instruct MIG or Cloud Run scaling policies](https://TODO).
     - [OCI Data Science/AI services that produce dynamic scale signals consumed by instance pools or OKE clusters](https://TODO).

1. **Adopt Sustainable/Green Autoscaling Policies**
   - If your usage is flexible, consider shifting workloads to times or regions with lower carbon intensity:
     - [AWS Sustainability Pillar in Well-Architected + region carbon metrics for scheduling large tasks](https://TODO).
     - [Azure Emissions Impact Dashboard integrated with scheduled scale tasks in greener data center regions](https://TODO).
     - [GCP Carbon Footprint + advanced scheduling for HPC tasks during lower carbon periods](https://TODO).
     - [OCI region-level sustainability data combined with custom autoscaling triggers for environment-friendly computing](https://TODO).
   - This step can integrate cost savings with environmental commitments, aligning with [Greening Government Commitments](https://TODO).

By blending advanced SLO-based scaling, multi-provider strategies, cost forecasting, ML-driven anomaly detection, and sustainability considerations, you ensure your autoscaling remains cutting-edge.
