### **Peak Provisioning:** Capacity is typically provisioned based on peak usage estimates, potentially leading to underutilization during off-peak times.

### **Manual Scaling Based on Average Consumption:** Capacity is provisioned for average usage, with manual scaling adjustments made seasonally or as needed.

### **Basic Autoscaling for Certain Components:** Autoscaling is enabled for some cloud components, primarily based on simple capacity or utilization metrics.

### **Widespread Autoscaling with Basic Metrics:** Autoscaling is a common practice, although it mainly utilizes basic metrics, with limited use of log or application-specific metrics.

### **Advanced Autoscaling Using Detailed Metrics:** Autoscaling is ubiquitously used, based on sophisticated log or application metrics, allowing for highly responsive and efficient capacity allocation.
