### **Basic Vendor Reliance:** Sustainability isn't actively measured internally; reliance is placed on cloud vendors who are contractually obligated to work towards carbon neutrality, likely through offsetting.

### **Initial Awareness and Basic Policies:** Some basic policies and goals for sustainability are set. Efforts are primarily focused on awareness and selecting vendors with better environmental records.

### **Active Measurement and Target Setting:** The organization actively measures its cloud compute carbon footprint and sets specific targets for reduction. This includes choosing cloud services based on their sustainability metrics.

### **Integrated Sustainability Practices:** Sustainability is integrated into cloud resource planning and usage. This includes regular monitoring and reporting on sustainability metrics and making adjustments to improve environmental impact.

### **Advanced Optimization and Dynamic Management:** Advanced strategies are in place, like automatic time and location shifting of workloads to minimize impact. Data retention and cloud product selection are deeply aligned with sustainability goals and carbon footprint metrics.
