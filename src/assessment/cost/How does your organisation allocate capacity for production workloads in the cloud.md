### **Peak Provisioning:** Capacity is typically provisioned based on peak usage estimates, potentially leading to underutilisation during off-peak times.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

When an organisation provisions capacity solely based on the highest possible load (peak usage), it generally results in:

1. **High Reliance on Worst-Case Scenarios**

   - You assume your daily or seasonal peak might occur at any time, so you allocate enough VMs, containers, or resources to handle that load continuously.
   - This can be seen as "good enough" if your traffic is extremely spiky, mission-critical, or your downtime tolerance is near zero.

1. **Predictable But Potentially Wasteful Costs**

   - By maintaining peak capacity around the clock, your spend is predictable, but you may overpay substantially during off-peak hours.
   - This might be acceptable if your budget is not severely constrained or if your leadership prioritises simplicity over optimisation.

1. **Minimal Operational Complexity**

   - No advanced autoscaling or reconfiguration scripts are needed, as you do not scale up or down dynamically.
   - For teams with limited cloud or DevOps expertise, "peak provisioning" might be temporarily "good enough."

1. **Compliance or Regulatory Factors**
   - Certain government services may face strict requirements that demand consistent capacity. If scaling or re-provisioning poses risk to meeting an SLA, you may choose to keep peak capacity as a safer option.

You might find "Peak Provisioning" still acceptable if cost oversight is low, your risk threshold is minimal, and you prefer operational simplicity. However, with public sector budgets under increasing scrutiny and user load patterns often varying significantly, this approach often wastes resources—both financial and environmental.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** steps to reduce waste and move beyond provisioning for the extreme peak:

1. **Implement Resource Monitoring and Basic Analytics**

   - Gather usage metrics to understand actual peaks, off-peak times, and daily/weekly cycles:
     - [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) metrics + [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) to see usage vs. cost patterns
     - [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/monitor/) + [Azure Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cost-management/) for hourly/daily usage trends
     - [GCP Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) + [GCP Billing reports (BigQuery export for deeper analysis)](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery)
     - [OCI Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm) + [OCI Cost Analysis](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/content?contentId=110943915) for instance-level metrics
     - [IBM Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-getting-started) + [IBM Cloud Cost Estimator](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-calculator) for hourly usage and trends
   - Share this data with stakeholders to highlight the discrepancy between peak vs. average usage.

1. **Pilot Scheduled Shutdowns for Non-Critical Systems**

   - Identify development and testing environments or batch-processing servers that don’t require 24/7 availability:
     - Utilise [AWS Instance Scheduler](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/instance-scheduler-on-aws/) to automate start and stop times for Amazon EC2 and RDS instances.
     - Implement [Azure Automation's Start/Stop VMs v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-solution-vm-management) to manage virtual machines on user-defined schedules.
     - Apply [Google Cloud's Instance Schedules](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/schedule-instance-start-stop) to automatically start and stop Compute Engine instances based on a schedule.
     - Use [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Resource Scheduler](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/resource-scheduler/concepts/resourcescheduler-overview.htm) to manage compute instances' power states according to defined schedules.
     - Use [IBM Cloud Schedule Scaling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-scheduled-scaling-vpc&interface=ui) to add or remove instance group capacity, based on daily, intermittent, or seasonal demand. You can create multiple scheduled actions that scale capacity monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, or even every set number of minutes.
   - Sharing this data with stakeholders can highlight the discrepancy between peak and average usage, demonstrating immediate cost savings without impacting production systems.

1. **Explore Simple Autoscaling Solutions**

   - Even if you continue peak provisioning for mission-critical workloads, consider selecting a smaller or non-critical service to test autoscaling:

     - [AWS Auto Scaling Groups – basic CPU-based triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scale-based-on-demand.html): Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling allows you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on CPU utilisation or other metrics, ensuring your application scales to meet demand.

     - [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets – scale by CPU or memory usage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-overview): Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets enable you to create and manage a group of load-balanced VMs, automatically scaling the number of instances based on CPU or memory usage to match your workload demands.

     - [GCP Managed Instance Groups – autoscale based on utilisation thresholds](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler): Google Cloud's Managed Instance Groups provide autoscaling capabilities that adjust the number of VM instances based on utilsation metrics, such as CPU usage, to accommodate changing workloads.

     - [OCI Instance Pool Autoscaling – CPU or custom metrics triggers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/autoscalinginstancepools.htm): Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Instance Pool Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of instances in a pool based on CPU utilisation or custom metrics, helping to optimise performance and cost.

     - [IBM Cloud Auto Scale for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group&interface=ui) allows you to create an instance group to scale according to your requirements. Based on the target utilisation metrics that you define, the instance group can dynamically add or remove instances to achieve your specified instance availability.

Implementing autoscaling in a controlled environment allows you to evaluate its benefits and challenges, providing valuable insights before considering broader adoption for more critical workloads.

1. **Review Reserved or Discounted Pricing**

   - If you must maintain consistently high capacity, consider vendor discount programs to reduce per-hour costs:

     - [AWS Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/) or [Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/): AWS offers Savings Plans, which provide flexibility by allowing you to commit to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured in $/hour) over a 1- or 3-year term, applicable across various services and regions. Reserved Instances, on the other hand, involve committing to specific instance configurations for a term, offering significant discounts for predictable workloads.

     - [Azure Reservations for VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/) and [Reserved Capacity](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/reserved-capacity/): Azure provides Reservations that allow you to commit to a specific VM or database service for a 1- or 3-year period, resulting in cost savings compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. These reservations are ideal for workloads with predictable resource requirements.

     - [GCP Committed Use Discounts](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts): Google Cloud offers Committed Use Discounts, enabling you to commit to a certain amount of usage for a 1- or 3-year term, which can lead to substantial savings for steady-state or predictable workloads.

     - [OCI Universal Credits](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/pricing/): Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides Universal Credits, allowing you to utilise any OCI platform service in any region with a flexible consumption model. By purchasing a sufficient number of credits, you can benefit from volume discounts and predictable billing, which is advantageous for maintaining high-capacity workloads.

     - [IBM Cloud Reservations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-reserved-virtual-servers-vpc) are a great option when you want significant cost savings and dedicated resources for future deployments. You can choose a 1 or 3-year term, server quantity, specific profile, and provision those servers when needed. [IBM Cloud Enterprise Savings Plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/enterprise-management?topic=enterprise-management-committed-use), with this billing model, you commit to spend a certain amount on IBM Cloud and receive discounts across the platform. You are billed monthly based on your usage and you continue to receive a discount even after you reach your committed amount.

   - Implementing these discount programs won’t eliminate over-provisioning but can soften the budget impact.

1. **Engage Leadership on the Financial and Sustainability Benefits**
   - Present how on-demand autoscaling or even basic scheduling can reduce overhead and potentially improve your service’s environmental footprint.
   - Link these improvements to departmental net-zero or cost reduction goals, highlighting easy wins.

Through monitoring, scheduling, basic autoscaling pilots, and potential reserved capacity, you can move away from static peak provisioning. This approach preserves reliability while unlocking efficiency gains—an important step in balancing cost, compliance, and performance goals in the UK public sector.

### **Manual Scaling Based on Average Consumption:** Capacity is provisioned for average usage, with manual scaling adjustments made seasonally or as needed.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

This stage represents an improvement over peak provisioning: you size your environment around typical usage rather than the maximum. You might see this as "good enough" if:

1. **Periodic But Manageable Traffic Patterns**

   - You may only observe seasonal spikes (e.g., monthly end-of-period reporting, yearly enrollments, etc.). Manually scaling before known events could be sufficient.
   - The overhead of full autoscaling might not seem worthwhile if spikes are infrequent and predictable.

1. **Comfortable Manual Operations**

   - You have a change-management process that can quickly add or remove capacity on a known schedule (e.g., scaling up ahead of local council tax billing cycles).
   - If your staff can handle these tasks promptly, the organisation might see no urgency in adopting automated approaches.

1. **Budgets and Costs Partially Optimised**

   - By aligning capacity to average usage (rather than peak), you reduce some waste. You might see moderate cost savings compared to peak provisioning.
   - The cost overhead from less frequent or smaller over-provisioning might be tolerable.

1. **Stable or Slow-Growing Environments**
   - If your cloud usage is not rapidly increasing, a manual approach might not yet lead to major inefficiencies.
   - You have limited real-time or unpredictable usage surges.

That said, manual scaling can become a bottleneck if usage unexpectedly grows or if multiple applications need frequent changes. The risk is human error (forgetting to scale back down), delayed response to traffic spikes, or missed budget opportunities.

#### **How to do better**

Here are **rapidly actionable** steps to evolve from manual seasonal scaling to a more automated, responsive model:

1. **Automate the Manual Steps You Already Do**

   - If you anticipate seasonal peaks (e.g., quarterly public reporting load), replace manual processes with scheduled scripts to ensure timely scaling and prevent missed scale-downs:

     - **AWS**: Utilise [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) in conjunction with [Amazon EventBridge Scheduler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/using-eventbridge-scheduler.html) to automate the start and stop of EC2 instances based on a defined schedule.

     - **Azure**: Implement [Azure Automation Runbooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-runbook-types) within Automation Accounts to create scripts that manage the scaling of resources during peak periods.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Leverage [Cloud Scheduler](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler) to trigger [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) or [Terraform](https://cloud.google.com/terraform) scripts that adjust instance groups in response to anticipated load changes.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**: Use [Resource Manager](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm) stacks combined with [Cron](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/schedulinginstanceactions.htm) tasks to schedule scaling events, ensuring resources are appropriately managed during peak times.

   - Automating these processes ensures that scaling actions occur as planned, reducing the risk of human error and optimising resource utilisation during peak and off-peak periods.

1. **Identify and Enforce "Scale-Back" Windows**

   - Even if you scale up for busy times, ensure you have a defined "sunset" for increased capacity:
     - Configure an autoscaling group or scale set to revert to default size after the peak.
     - Set reminders or triggers to ensure you don’t pay for extra capacity indefinitely.

1. **Introduce Autoscaling on a Limited Component**

   - Choose a module that frequently experiences load variations within a day or week—perhaps a web front-end for a public information portal:

     - **AWS**: Implement [Auto Scaling Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scale-based-on-demand.html) with CPU-based or request-based triggers to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances handling your service's load.

     - **Azure**: Utilise [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/) or the [AKS Cluster Autoscaler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-autoscaler-overview) to manage the scaling of virtual machines or Kubernetes clusters for your busiest microservices.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Use [Managed Instance Groups](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler) with load-based autoscaling to dynamically adjust the number of instances serving your front-end application based on real-time demand.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**: Apply [Instance Pool Autoscaling](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/autoscalinginstancepools.htm) or the [OKE Cluster Autoscaler](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengautoscaling.htm) to automatically scale a specific containerised service in response to workload changes.

   - Implementing autoscaling on a targeted component allows you to observe immediate benefits, such as improved resource utilisation and cost efficiency, which can encourage broader adoption across your infrastructure.

1. **Consider Serverless for Spiky Components**

   - If certain tasks run sporadically (e.g., monthly data transformation or PDF generation), investigate moving them to event-driven or serverless solutions:

     - **AWS**: Utilise [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for event-driven functions or [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) for running containers without managing servers. AWS Lambda is ideal for short-duration, event-driven tasks, while AWS Fargate is better suited for longer-running applications and tasks requiring intricate orchestration.

     - **Azure**: Implement [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions/) for serverless compute, [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/logic-apps/) for workflow automation, or [Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps/) for running microservices and containerised applications. Azure Logic Apps can automate workflows and business processes, making them suitable for scheduled tasks.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Deploy [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) for lightweight event-driven functions or [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) for running containerised applications in a fully managed environment. Cloud Run is suitable for web-based workloads, REST or gRPC APIs, and internal custom back-office apps.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**: Use [OCI Functions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm) for on-demand, serverless workloads. OCI Functions is a fully managed, multi-tenant, highly scalable, on-demand, Functions-as-a-Service platform built on enterprise-grade infrastructure.

   - Transitioning to serverless solutions for sporadic tasks eliminates the need to manually adjust virtual machines for short bursts, enhancing efficiency and reducing operational overhead.

1. **Monitor and Alert on Usage Deviations**

   - Utilise cost and performance alerts to detect unexpected surges or prolonged idle resources:

     - **AWS**: Implement [AWS Budgets](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/) to set custom cost and usage thresholds, receiving alerts when limits are approached or exceeded. Additionally, use [Amazon CloudWatch's anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Anomaly_Detection.html) to monitor metrics and identify unusual patterns in resource utilisation.

     - **Azure**: Set up [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/monitor/) alerts to track resource performance and configure cost anomaly alerts within [Azure Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/analyze-unexpected-charges) to detect and notify you of unexpected spending patterns.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Create budgets in [Google Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets) and configure Pub/Sub notifications to receive alerts on cost anomalies, enabling prompt responses to unexpected expenses.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**: Establish budgets and set up alert rules in [OCI Cost Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Billing/Tasks/managingalertrules.htm) to monitor spending. Additionally, configure [OCI Alarms](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/implement-oci-observability-monitoring/configure-alarms-and-notifications1.html) with notifications to detect and respond to unusual resource usage patterns.

   - Implementing these alerts enables quicker responses to anomalies, reducing the reliance on manual monitoring and helping to maintain optimal resource utilisation and cost efficiency.

By automating your manual scaling processes, exploring partial autoscaling, and shifting spiky tasks to serverless, you unlock more agility and cost efficiency. This approach helps ensure you’re not left scrambling if usage deviates from seasonal patterns.

### **Basic Autoscaling for Certain Components:** Autoscaling is enabled for some cloud components, primarily based on simple capacity or utilisation metrics.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this stage, you’ve moved beyond purely manual methods: some of your workloads automatically scale in or out when CPU, memory, or queue depth crosses a threshold. This can be "good enough" if:

1. **Limited Service Scope**

   - You have identified a few critical or high-variance components (e.g., your front-end web tier) that benefit significantly from autoscaling.
   - Remaining workloads may be stable or less likely to see large traffic swings.

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**

   - You deliberately keep autoscaling rules straightforward (e.g., CPU > 70% for 5 minutes) to avoid over-engineering.
   - This might meet departmental objectives, provided the load pattern doesn’t vary unpredictably.

1. **Reduced Manual Overhead**

   - Thanks to autoscaling on certain components, you rarely intervene during typical usage spikes.
   - You still handle major events or seasonal shifts manually, but day-to-day usage is more stable.

1. **Partially Controlled Costs**
   - Because your most dynamic workloads scale automatically, you see fewer cost overruns from over-provisioning.
   - You still might maintain some underutilised capacity for other components, but it’s acceptable given your risk appetite.

If your environment only sees moderate changes in demand and leadership doesn’t demand full elasticity, "Basic Autoscaling for Certain Components" can suffice. However, if your user base or usage patterns expand, or if you aim for deeper cost optimisation, you could unify autoscaling across more workloads and utilise advanced triggers.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **actionable** ways to upgrade from basic autoscaling:

1. **Broaden Autoscaling Coverage**

   - Extend autoscaling to more workloads to enhance efficiency and responsiveness:

     - **AWS**:

       - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Implement the [AKS Cluster Autoscaler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-scale) to automatically adjust the number of nodes in your cluster based on resource requirements.
       - **Azure SQL Elastic Pools**: Use [Azure SQL Elastic Pools](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-sql/elastic-pools/) to manage and scale multiple databases with varying usage patterns, optimising resource utilisation and cost.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:

       - **Managed Instance Groups (MIGs)**: Expand the use of [Managed Instance Groups](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups) with autoscaling across multiple zones to ensure high availability and automatic scaling of your applications.
       - **Cloud SQL Autoscaling**: Leverage [Cloud SQL's automatic storage increase](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/instance-settings#automatic_storage_increase) to handle growing database storage needs without manual intervention.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**:
       - **Instance Pool Autoscaling**: Apply [OCI Instance Pool Autoscaling](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/autoscalinginstancepools.htm) to additional workloads, enabling automatic adjustment of compute resources based on performance metrics.
       - **Database Auto Scaling**: Utilise [OCI Autonomous Database Auto Scaling](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Database/Tasks/adbscaling.htm) to automatically scale compute and storage resources in response to workload demands.

   - Gradually incorporating more of your application's microservices into the autoscaling framework can lead to improved performance, cost efficiency, and resilience across your infrastructure.

1. **Incorporate More Granular Metrics**

   - Move beyond simple CPU-based thresholds to handle memory usage, disk I/O, or application-level concurrency:

     - **AWS**: Implement [Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html) to monitor specific parameters such as memory usage, disk I/O, or application-level metrics. Additionally, utilise [Application Load Balancer (ALB) request count](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.html) to trigger autoscaling based on incoming traffic.

     - **Azure**: Use [Azure Monitor custom metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-custom-overview) to track specific performance indicators like queue length or HTTP request rate. These metrics can feed into [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-overview) or the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Horisontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-scale) for more responsive scaling.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Leverage [Google Cloud's Monitoring custom metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics) to capture detailed performance data. Implement request-based autoscaling in [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/horisontalpodautoscaler) or [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/autoscaling) to adjust resources based on real-time demand.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**: Utilise [OCI Monitoring service's custom metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/buildingcustommetrics.htm) to track parameters such as queue depth, memory usage, or user concurrency. These metrics can inform autoscaling decisions to ensure optimal performance.

   - Incorporating more granular metrics allows for precise autoscaling, ensuring that resources are allocated based on comprehensive performance indicators rather than relying solely on CPU usage.

1. **Implement Dynamic, Scheduled, or Predictive Scaling**

   - If you observe consistent patterns in your application's usage—such as increased activity during lunchtime or reduced traffic on weekends—consider enhancing your existing autoscaling strategies with scheduled scaling actions:

     - **AWS**: Configure [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling scheduled actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/schedule_time.html) to adjust capacity at predetermined times. For instance, you can set the system to scale up at 08:00 and scale down at 20:00 to align with daily usage patterns.

     - **Azure**: Utilise [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-scheduled-events) to implement scheduled scaling. Additionally, integrate scaling adjustments into your [Azure DevOps pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops) to automate capacity changes in response to anticipated workload variations.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Employ [Managed Instance Group (MIG) scheduled scaling](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/scheduled-scaling) to define scaling behaviors based on time-based schedules. Alternatively, use [Cloud Scheduler](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler) to trigger scripts that adjust resources in line with expected demand fluctuations.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**: Set up [scheduled autoscaling for instance pools](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/schedulingautoscalingactions.htm) to manage resource allocation according to known usage patterns. You can also deploy [Oracle Functions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm) to execute timed scaling events, ensuring resources are appropriately scaled during peak and off-peak periods.

   - Implementing scheduled scaling allows your system to proactively adjust resources in anticipation of predictable workload changes, enhancing performance and cost efficiency.

   - For environments with variable and unpredictable workloads, consider utilising predictive scaling features. Predictive scaling analyzes historical data to forecast future demand, enabling the system to scale resources in advance of anticipated spikes. This approach combines the benefits of both proactive and reactive scaling, ensuring optimal resource availability and responsiveness.

     - **AWS**: Explore [Predictive Scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html), which uses machine learning models to forecast traffic patterns and adjust capacity accordingly.

     - **Azure**: While Azure does not currently offer a native predictive scaling feature, you can implement custom solutions by analyzing historical metrics through [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/monitor/) and creating automation scripts to adjust scaling based on predicted trends.

     - **GCP**: Google Cloud's [autoscaler](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler) primarily operates on real-time metrics. For predictive capabilities, consider developing custom predictive models using historical data from [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) to inform scaling decisions.

     - **OCI**: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure allows for the creation of custom scripts and functions to implement predictive scaling based on historical usage patterns, although a native predictive scaling feature may not be available.

   - By integrating scheduled and predictive scaling strategies, you can enhance your application's ability to handle varying workloads efficiently, ensuring optimal performance while managing costs effectively.

1. **Enhance Observability to Validate Autoscaling Efficacy**

   - Instrument your autoscaling events and track them to ensure optimal performance and resource utilisation:

     - **Dashboard Real-Time Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, and queue metrics alongside scaling events to visualise system performance in real-time.

     - **Analyze Scaling Timeliness**: Assess whether scaling actions occur promptly by checking for prolonged high CPU usage or frequent scale-in events that may indicate over-scaling.

   - **Tools**:

     - **AWS**:

       - **AWS X-Ray**: Utilise [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) to trace requests through your application, gaining insights into performance bottlenecks and the impact of scaling events.

       - **Amazon CloudWatch**: Create dashboards in [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to display real-time metrics and logs, correlating them with scaling activities for comprehensive monitoring.

     - **Azure**:

       - **Azure Monitor**: Leverage [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/monitor/) to collect and analyze telemetry data, setting up alerts and visualisations to track performance metrics in relation to scaling events.

       - **Application Insights**: Use [Azure Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to detect anomalies and diagnose issues, correlating scaling actions with application performance for deeper analysis.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:

       - **Cloud Monitoring**: Employ [Google Cloud's Operations Suite](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations) to monitor and visualise metrics, setting up dashboards that reflect the relationship between resource utilisation and scaling events.

       - **Cloud Logging and Tracing**: Implement [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging) and [Cloud Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace) to collect logs and trace data, enabling the analysis of autoscaling impacts on application performance.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**:

       - **OCI Logging**: Use [OCI Logging](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Logging/Concepts/loggingoverview.htm) to manage and search logs, providing visibility into scaling events and their effects on system performance.

       - **OCI Monitoring**: Utilise [OCI Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm) to track metrics and set alarms, ensuring that scaling actions align with performance expectations.

   - By enhancing observability, you can validate the effectiveness of your autoscaling strategies, promptly identify and address issues, and optimise resource allocation to maintain application performance and cost efficiency.

1. **Adopt Spot/Preemptible Instances for Autoscaled Non-Critical Workloads**

   - To further optimise costs, consider utilising spot or preemptible virtual machines (VMs) for non-critical, autoscaled workloads. These instances are offered at significant discounts compared to standard on-demand instances but can be terminated by the cloud provider when resources are needed elsewhere. Therefore, they are best suited for fault-tolerant and flexible applications.

     - **AWS**: Implement [EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) within an Auto Scaling Group to run fault-tolerant workloads at up to 90% off the On-Demand price. By configuring Auto Scaling groups with mixed instances, you can combine Spot Instances with On-Demand Instances to balance cost and availability.

     - **Azure**: Utilise [Azure Spot Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/spot-vms) within Virtual Machine Scale Sets for non-critical workloads. Azure Spot VMs allow you to take advantage of unused capacity at significant cost savings, making them ideal for interruptible workloads such as batch processing jobs and development/testing environments.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Deploy [Preemptible VMs](https://cloud.google.com/preemptible-vms) in Managed Instance Groups to run short-duration, fault-tolerant workloads at a reduced cost. Preemptible VMs provide substantial savings for workloads that can tolerate interruptions, such as data analysis and batch processing tasks.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**: Leverage [Preemptible Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/runninginstances.htm#preemptible) for batch processing or flexible tasks. OCI Preemptible Instances offer a cost-effective solution for workloads that are resilient to interruptions, enabling efficient scaling of non-critical applications.

   - By integrating these cost-effective instance types into your autoscaling strategies, you can significantly reduce expenses for non-critical workloads while maintaining the flexibility to scale resources as needed.

By broadening autoscaling across more components, incorporating richer metrics, scheduling, and advanced cost strategies like spot instances, you transform your "basic" scaling approach into a more agile, cost-effective solution. Over time, these steps foster robust, automated resource management across your entire environment.

### **Widespread Autoscaling with Basic Metrics:** Autoscaling is a common practice, although it mainly utilises basic metrics, with limited use of log or application-specific metrics.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

You’ve expanded autoscaling across many workloads: from front-end services to internal APIs, possibly including some data processing components. However, you’re mostly using CPU, memory, or standard throughput metrics as triggers. This can be "good enough" if:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**

   - Most of your core applications scale automatically as demand changes. Manual interventions are rare and usually revolve around unusual events or big product launches.

1. **Efficient Day-to-Day Operations**

   - Cost and capacity usage are largely optimised since few resources remain significantly underutilised or idle.
   - Staff seldom worry about reconfiguring capacity for typical fluctuations.

1. **Satisfactory Performance**

   - Using basic metrics (CPU, memory) covers typical load patterns adequately.
   - The risk of slower scale-up in more complex scenarios (like surges in queue lengths or specific user transactions) might be acceptable.

1. **Stable or Predictable Load Growth**
   - Even with widespread autoscaling, if your usage grows in somewhat predictable increments, basic triggers might suffice.
   - You rarely need to investigate advanced logs or correlation with end-user response times to refine scaling.

If your service-level objectives (SLOs) and budgets remain met with these simpler triggers, you may be comfortable. However, more advanced autoscaling can yield better responsiveness for spiky or complex applications that rely heavily on queue lengths, user concurrency, or custom application metrics (e.g., transactions per second, memory leaks, etc.).

#### **How to do better**

Here are **actionable** ways to refine your widespread autoscaling strategy to handle more nuanced workloads:

1. **Adopt Application-Level or Log-Based Metrics**

   - Move beyond CPU and memory metrics to incorporate transaction rates, request latency, or user concurrency for more responsive and efficient autoscaling:

     - **AWS**:

       - **CloudWatch Custom Metrics**: Publish custom metrics derived from application logs to [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html), enabling monitoring of specific application-level indicators such as transaction rates and user concurrency.
       - **Real-Time Log Analysis with Kinesis and Lambda**: Set up real-time log analysis by streaming logs through [Amazon Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/amazon-kinesis-lambda.html) and processing them with AWS Lambda to generate dynamic scaling triggers based on application behavior.

     - **Azure**:

       - **Application Insights**: Utilise [Azure Monitor's Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to collect detailed usage data, including request rates and response times, which can inform scaling decisions for services hosted in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
       - **Custom Logs for Scaling Signals**: Implement custom logging to capture specific application metrics and configure Azure Monitor to use these logs as signals for autoscaling, enhancing responsiveness to real-time application demands.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:

       - **Cloud Monitoring Custom Metrics**: Create custom metrics in [Google Cloud's Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics) to track application-specific indicators such as request count, latency, or queue depth, facilitating more precise autoscaling of Compute Engine (GCE) instances or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters.
       - **Integration with Logging**: Combine [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs) with Cloud Monitoring to analyze application logs and derive metrics that can trigger autoscaling events based on real-time application performance.

       - **Logging Analytics**: Use [OCI Logging Analytics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Logging/Concepts/logginganalyticsoverview.htm) to process and analyze application logs, extracting metrics that reflect user concurrency or transaction rates, which can then be used to trigger autoscaling events.

   - Incorporating application-level and log-based metrics into your autoscaling strategy allows for more nuanced and effective scaling decisions, ensuring that resources align closely with actual application demands and improving overall performance and cost efficiency.

1. **Introduce Multi-Metric Policies**

   - Instead of a single threshold, combine metrics. For instance:
     - Scale up if CPU > 70% AND average request latency > 300ms.
     - This ensures you only scale when both resource utilisation and user experience degrade, reducing false positives or unneeded expansions.

1. **Implement Predictive or Machine Learning–Driven Autoscaling**

   - To anticipate demand spikes before traditional metrics like CPU utilisation react, consider implementing predictive or machine learning–driven autoscaling solutions offered by cloud providers:

     - **AWS**:

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**:
       - **Custom Analytics Integration**: Integrate [Oracle Analytics Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/analytics/) with OCI to perform machine learning–based forecasting, enabling predictive scaling by analyzing historical data and anticipating future resource requirements.

   - Implementing predictive or machine learning–driven autoscaling allows your applications to adjust resources proactively, maintaining performance and cost efficiency by anticipating demand before traditional metrics indicate the need for scaling.

1. **Correlate Autoscaling with End-User Experience**

   - To enhance user satisfaction, align your autoscaling strategies with user-centric metrics such as page load times and overall responsiveness. By monitoring these metrics, you can ensure that scaling actions directly improve the end-user experience.

     - **AWS**:

       - **Application Load Balancer (ALB) Target Response Times**: Monitor [ALB target response times](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.html) using Amazon CloudWatch to assess backend performance. Elevated response times can indicate the need for scaling to maintain optimal user experience.
       - **Network Load Balancer (NLB) Metrics**: Track [NLB metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.html) to monitor network performance and identify potential bottlenecks affecting end-user experience.

     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:

       - **Cloud Load Balancing Logs**: Examine [Cloud Load Balancing logs](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/monitoring) to assess request latency and backend performance. Use this data to adjust autoscaling policies, ensuring they align with user experience goals.
       - **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**: Define SLOs in [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/service-level-objectives) to set performance targets based on user-centric metrics, enabling proactive scaling to meet user expectations.

     - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**:
       - **Load Balancer Health Checks**: Implement [OCI Load Balancer health checks](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Balance/Tasks/managinghealthchecks.htm) to monitor backend server performance. Use health check data to inform autoscaling decisions that directly impact user experience.
       - **Custom Application Pings**: Set up custom application pings to measure response times and user concurrency, feeding this data into autoscaling triggers to maintain optimal performance during varying user loads.

   - By integrating user-centric metrics into your autoscaling logic, you ensure that scaling actions are directly correlated with improvements in end-user experience, leading to higher satisfaction and engagement.

1. **Refine Scaling Cooldowns and Timers**
   - Tweak scale-up and scale-down intervals to avoid thrashing:
     - A short scale-up delay can address spikes quickly.
     - A slightly longer scale-down delay prevents abrupt resource removals when a short spike recedes.
   - Evaluate your autoscaling policy settings monthly to align with evolving traffic patterns.

By incorporating more sophisticated application or log-based metrics, predictive scaling, and user-centric triggers, you ensure capacity aligns closely with real workloads. This approach elevates your autoscaling from a broad CPU/memory-based strategy to a finely tuned system that balances user experience, performance, and cost efficiency.

### **Advanced Autoscaling Using Detailed Metrics:** Autoscaling is ubiquitously used, based on sophisticated log or application metrics, allowing for highly responsive and efficient capacity allocation.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

In this final, most mature stage, your organisation applies advanced autoscaling across practically every production workload. Detailed logs, queue depths, user concurrency, or response times drive scaling decisions. This likely means:

1. **Holistic Observability and Telemetry**

   - You collect and analyze logs, metrics, and traces in near real-time, correlating them to auto-scale events.
   - Teams have dashboards that reflect business-level metrics (e.g., transactions processed, citizen requests served) to trigger expansions or contractions.

1. **Proactive or Predictive Scaling**

   - You anticipate traffic spikes based on historical data or usage trends (like major public announcements, election result postings, etc.).
   - Scale actions happen before a noticeable performance drop, offering a seamless user experience.

1. **Minimal Human Intervention**

   - Manual resizing is rare, reserved for extraordinary circumstances (e.g., emergent security patches, new application deployments).
   - Staff focus on refining autoscaling policies, not reacting to capacity emergencies.

1. **Cost-Optimised and Performance-Savvy**
   - Because you rarely over-provision for extended periods, your budget usage remains tightly aligned with actual needs.
   - End-users or citizens experience consistently fast response times due to prompt scale-outs.

If you find that your applications handle usage spikes gracefully, cost anomalies are rare, and advanced metrics keep everything stable, you have likely achieved an advanced autoscaling posture. Nevertheless, with the rapid evolution of cloud services, there are always methods to iterate and improve.

#### **How to do better**

Even at the top level, you can refine and push boundaries further:

1. **Adopt More Granular "Distributed SLO" Metrics**

   - **Evaluate Each Microservice's Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)**: Define precise SLOs for each microservice, such as ensuring the 99th-percentile latency remains under 400 milliseconds. This granular approach allows for targeted performance monitoring and scaling decisions.

   - **Utilise Cloud Provider Tools to Monitor and Enforce SLOs**:

     - **AWS**:

       - **CloudWatch ServiceLens**: Integrate [Amazon CloudWatch ServiceLens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html) to gain comprehensive insights into application performance and availability, correlating metrics, logs, and traces.

     - **Precision in Scaling**: By closely monitoring how each component meets its SLOs, you can make informed decisions to scale resources appropriately, balancing performance needs with cost considerations.

     - **Proactive Issue Detection**: Granular SLO metrics enable the early detection of performance degradations within specific microservices, allowing for timely interventions before they impact the overall system.

     - **Enhanced User Experience**: Maintaining stringent SLOs ensures that end-users receive consistent and reliable service, thereby improving satisfaction and trust in your application.

   - **Implementation Considerations**:

     - **Define Clear SLOs**: Collaborate with stakeholders to establish realistic and measurable SLOs for each microservice, considering factors such as latency, throughput, and error rates.

     - **Continuous Monitoring and Adjustment**: Regularly review and adjust SLOs and associated monitoring tools to adapt to evolving application requirements and user expectations.

   - **Conclusion**: Adopting more granular "distributed SLO" metrics empowers you to fine-tune your application's performance management, ensuring that each microservice operates within its defined parameters. This approach facilitates precise scaling decisions, optimising both performance and cost efficiency.

1. **Experiment with Multi-Provider or Hybrid Autoscaling**

   - If policy allows, or your architecture is containerised, test the feasibility of bursting into another region or cloud for capacity:
