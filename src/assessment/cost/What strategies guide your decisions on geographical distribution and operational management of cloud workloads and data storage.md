### **Intra-Region Distribution:** Workloads and data are spread across multiple availability zones within a single region to enhance availability and resilience.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

- **Moderate Tolerance for Region-Level Outages**  
  You may handle an AZ-level failure but might be vulnerable if the entire region goes offline.
- **Improved Availability Over Single AZ**  
  Achieving at least multi-AZ deployment typically satisfies many public sector continuity requirements, referencing [NCSC’s resilience guidelines](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps-to-cyber-security/resilience).
- **Cost vs. Redundancy**  
  Additional AZ usage may raise costs (like cross-AZ data transfer fees), but many find the availability trade-off beneficial.

If you still have concerns about entire regional outages or advanced compliance demands for multi-region or cross-geography distribution, consider a multi-region approach. [NIST SP 800-53 CP (Contingency Planning) controls](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800/53/r5/final) often encourage broader geographical resiliency if your RPO/RTO goals are strict.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to refine an intra-region approach:

1. **Enable Automatic Multi-AZ Deployments**

   - e.g., [AWS Auto Scaling groups across multiple AZs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-add-az-console.html), [Azure VM Scale Sets in multiple zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones), [GCP Managed Instance Groups (MIGs) or multi-zonal regional clusters](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/regional-migs), [OCI multi-AD distribution for compute/storage](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/cloud-training-architecture.pdf),[IBM Cloud Instance Group for Autoscaling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group&interface=ui).
   - Minimises manual overhead for distributing workloads.

1. **Replicate Data Synchronously**

   - For databases, consider regionally resilient services:
     - [AWS RDS Multi-AZ](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/)
     - [Azure SQL Zone Redundancy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/high-availability-sla-local-zone-redundancy?view=azuresql)
     - [GCP Cloud SQL HA](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/high-availability)
     - [OCI Data Guard in Multi-AD Mode](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/database-dbaas-cloud/csdbi/data-guard-configuration.html)
     - IBM Cloud: for [PostgreSQL](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-logical-replication), for [Cloudant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-replication-api), for MySQL & for [Cloud Databases](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-ha-dr)
   - Ensures quick failover if one Availability Zone (AZ) fails.

1. **Set AZ-Aware Networking**

   - Deploy separate subnets or load balancers for each Availability Zone (AZ) so traffic automatically reroutes upon an AZ failure:
     - [AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) with multi-AZ target groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/tutorial-multi-az.html)
     - [Azure Standard Load Balancer across zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-availability-zones)
     - [GCP Load Balancing with multi-zone backends](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/using-multi-regional-backends)
     - [OCI Load Balancer with multiple Availability Domain (AD) subnets](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/load-balancer/using-multi-ad.html)
     - IBM Cloud [Network Load Balancer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-integration-with-instance-groups) & [Application Load Balancer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-lbaas-integration-with-instance-groups)
   - Ensures high availability and fault tolerance by distributing traffic across multiple AZs.

1. **Regularly Test AZ Failover**

   - Induce a partial Availability Zone (AZ) outage or rely on "game days" to ensure applications properly degrade or failover:
     - Referencing [NCSC guidance on vulnerability management](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/vulnerability-management/guidance).
   - Ensures systems can handle unexpected disruptions effectively.

1. **Monitor Cross-AZ Costs**
   - Some vendors charge for data transfer between AZs, so monitor usage with [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/), [Azure Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cost-management/), [GCP Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing), [OCI Cost Analysis](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cost-analysis/), [IBM Cloud Billing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-charges) & [IBM Cost Estimator](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-calculator).

By automatically spreading workloads, replicating data in multiple AZs, ensuring AZ-aware networking, regularly testing failover, and monitoring cross-AZ costs, you solidify your organisation’s resilience within a single region while controlling costs.

### **Selective Multi-Region Utilisation:** An additional, legally compliant non-UK region is used for specific purposes, such as non-production workloads, certain data types, or as part of disaster recovery planning.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

- **Basic Multi-Region DR or Lower-Cost Testing**  
  You might offload dev/test to another region or keep backups in a different region for DR compliance.
- **Minimal Cross-Region Dependencies**  
  If you only replicate data or run certain non-critical workloads in the second region, partial coverage might suffice.
- **Meets Certain Compliance Needs**  
  Some public sector entities require data in at least two distinct legal jurisdictions—this setup may address that in limited scope.

If entire production workloads are mission-critical for national services or must handle region-level outages seamlessly, you might consider a more robust multi-region active-active approach. [NIST SP 800-34 DR guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800/34/r5/final) often advise multi-region for critical continuity.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** improvements:

1. **Automate Cross-Region Backups**

   - e.g., [AWS S3 Cross-Region Replication](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/cross-region-replication/), [Azure Backup to another region](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms), [GCP Snapshot replication](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/cross-region-snapshots), [OCI cross-region object replication](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/object-storage/cross-region-replication/).
   - Minimises manual tasks and ensures consistent DR coverage.

1. **Schedule Non-Production in Cheaper Regions**

   - If cost is a driver, shut down dev/test in off-peak times or run them in a region with lower rates:
     - Referencing your chosen vendor’s regional pricing page.

1. **Establish a Basic DR Plan**

   - For the second region, define how you’d bring up minimal services if the primary region fails:
     - Referencing [AWS CloudEndure](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudendure/), [RDS cross-region read replicas](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/cross-region-read-replicas/), [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/site-recovery/), [GCP DR solutions](https://cloud.google.com/disaster-recovery), [OCI Disaster Recovery orchestration](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/disaster-recovery/).

1. **Regularly Test Failover**

   - Do partial or full DR exercises at least annually, ensuring data in the second region can spin up quickly.
   - Referencing [NIST SP 800-34 DR test recommendations or NCSC operational resilience playbooks](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800/34/r5/final).

1. **Plan for Data Residency**
   - If using non-UK regions, confirm any legal constraints on data location, referencing [GOV.UK data residency rules or relevant departmental guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/offshoring-data-guidance).

By automating cross-region backups, offloading dev/test workloads where cost is lower, defining a minimal DR plan, regularly testing failover, and ensuring data residency compliance, you expand from a single-region approach to a modest but effective multi-region strategy.

### **Capability and Sustainability-Driven Selection:** Regions are chosen based solely on their technical capabilities, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability credentials, without any specific technical constraints.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

- **Advanced Region Flexibility**  
  You pick the region that offers the best HPC, GPU, or AI services, or one with the lowest carbon footprint or cost.
- **Sustainability & Cost Prioritised**  
  If your organisation strongly values green energy sourcing or cheaper nighttime rates, you shift workloads accordingly.
- **No Hard Legal Data Residency Constraints**  
  You can store data outside the UK or EEA as permitted, and no critical constraints block you from picking any global region.

If you want to adapt in real time based on cost or carbon intensity or maintain advanced multi-region failover automatically, consider a dynamic approach. [NCSC’s guidance on green hosting or multi-region usage](/TODO) and [NIST frameworks for dynamic cloud management](/TODO) can guide advanced scheduling.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** enhancements:

1. **Sustainability-Driven Tools**

   - e.g., [AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-customer-carbon-footprint-tool/), [Azure Carbon Optimisation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/carbon-optimisation/view-emissions), [GCP Carbon Footprint](https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/carbon-footprint), [OCI Carbon Footprint](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/carbon-footprint.html).
   - Evaluate region choices for best environmental impact.

1. **Implement Real-Time Cost & Perf Monitoring**

   - Track usage and cost by region daily or hourly.
   - Referencing [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/), [Azure Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cost-management/), [GCP Billing Alerts](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/alerts), [OCI Cost Analysis](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cost-analysis/).

1. **Enable Multi-Region Data Sync**

   - If you shift workloads for HPC or AI tasks, ensure data is pre-replicated to the chosen region:
     - Referencing [AWS S3 Cross-Region Replication](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/cross-region-replication/), [Azure Geo-Redundant Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#geo-redundant-storage-grs-or-read-access-geo-redundant-storage-ra-grs), [GCP Multi-Region Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cross-region-replication), [OCI cross-region replication](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/object-storage/cross-region-replication/).

1. **Address Latency & End-User Performance**

   - For services with user-facing components, consider CDN edges, multi-region front-end load balancing, or local read replicas to ensure acceptable performance.

1. **Document Region Swapping Procedures**
   - If you occasionally relocate entire workloads for cost or sustainability, define runbooks or scripts to manage DB replication, DNS updates, and environment spin-up.

By using sustainability calculators to choose greener regions, implementing real-time cost/performance checks, ensuring multi-region data readiness, managing user latency via CDNs or local replicas, and documenting region-swapping, you fully leverage each provider’s global footprint for cost and environmental benefits.

### **Dynamic and Cost-Sustainable Distribution:** Workloads are dynamically allocated across various regions and availability zones, with scheduling optimised for cost-efficiency and sustainability, adapting in real-time to changing conditions.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Your organisation pursues a true multi-region, multi-AZ dynamic approach. Automated processes shift workloads based on real-time cost (spot prices) or carbon intensity, while preserving performance and compliance. This may be "good enough" if:

1. **Highly Automated Infrastructure**

   - You rely on complex orchestration or container platforms that can scale or move workloads near-instantly.

1. **Advanced Observability**

   - A robust system of metrics, logging, and anomaly detection ensures seamless adaptation to cost or sustainability triggers.

1. **Continuous Risk & Compliance Checks**
   - Even though workloads shift globally, you remain compliant with relevant data sovereignty or classification rules, referencing [NCSC data handling](/TODO) or departmental policies.

Nevertheless, you can refine HPC or AI edge cases, adopt chaos testing for dynamic distribution, or integrate advanced zero trust for each region shift. [NIST SP 800-207 zero-trust architecture principles](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800/207/final) can help ensure each region transition remains secure.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** methods to refine dynamic, cost-sustainable distribution:

1. **Automate Workload Placement**

   - Tools like [AWS Spot Instance with EC2 Fleet, Azure Spot VMs with scale sets, GCP Preemptible VMs, OCI Preemptible Instances] or container orchestrators that factor region costs:
     - referencing vendor cost management APIs or third-party cost analytics.

1. **Use Real-Time Carbon & Pricing Signals**

   - e.g., [AWS Instance Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html) + carbon data, [Azure carbon footprint metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/carbon-optimization/view-emissions), [GCP Carbon Footprint reports](https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint), [OCI sustainability stats](https://oci-global.com/sustainability/).
   - Shift workloads to the region with the best real-time carbon intensity or lowest spot price.

1. **Add Continual Governance**

   - Ensure no region usage violates data residency constraints or compliance:
     - referencing NCSC multi-region compliance advice or departmental data classification guidelines.

1. **Embrace Chaos Engineering**

   - Regularly test failover or region-shifting events to ensure dynamic distribution can recover from partial region outages or surges:
     - Referencing [NCSC guidance on chaos engineering](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/advice-guidance/all-topics) or vendor solutions:
       - [AWS Fault Injection Simulator](https://aws.amazon.com/fault-injection-simulator/)
       - [Azure Chaos Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/)
       - [GCP Chaos Mesh](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh)
       - [OCI Chaos Engineering](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/chaos-engineering.html)
   - These tools help simulate real-world disruptions, allowing you to observe system behavior and enhance resilience.

1. **Integrate Advanced DevSecOps**
   - For each region shift, the pipeline or orchestrator re-checks security posture and cost thresholds in real time.

By automating workload placement with spot or preemptible instances, factoring real-time carbon and cost signals, applying continuous data residency checks, stress-testing region shifts with chaos engineering, and embedding advanced DevSecOps validations, you maintain a dynamic, cost-sustainable distribution model that meets the highest operational and environmental standards for UK public sector services.

**Keep doing what you’re doing,** and consider blogging about or opening pull requests to share how you handle multi-region distribution and operational management for cloud workloads. This information can help other UK public sector organisations adopt or improve similar approaches in alignment with NCSC, NIST, and GOV.UK best-practice guidance.
