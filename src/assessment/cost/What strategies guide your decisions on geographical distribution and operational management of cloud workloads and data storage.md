### **Single Zone, Constant Operation:** All data and workloads are confined to a single availability zone within an approved region, with workloads typically running continuously.

### **Intra-Region Distribution:** Workloads and data are spread across multiple availability zones within a single region to enhance availability and resilience.

### **Selective Multi-Region Utilization:** An additional, legally compliant non-UK region is used for specific purposes, such as non-production workloads, certain data types, or as part of disaster recovery planning.

### **Capability and Sustainability-Driven Selection:** Regions are chosen based solely on their technical capabilities, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability credentials, without any specific technical constraints.

### **Dynamic and Cost-Sustainable Distribution:** Workloads are dynamically allocated across various regions and availability zones, with scheduling optimized for cost-efficiency and sustainability, adapting in real-time to changing conditions.
