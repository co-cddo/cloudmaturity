### **Monolithic Applications with Wide Technology Stack:** The predominant architecture is monolithic, with applications deployed as single, indivisible units encompassing a wide range of technologies.

### **Modular but Not Independently Deployable:** Applications are broken down into modules, offering greater development flexibility, yet these modules are not deployable as independent components.

### **Modularized and Individually Deployable Components:** Applications are structured into self-contained, individually deployable components. However, significant interdependencies add complexity to testing.

### **Mostly Independent Deployment with Some Monoliths:** While most application components are independently deployable and testable, a few core system components still rely on a monolithic architecture.

### **Fully Component-Based Modular Architecture:** The technology stack consistently utilizes a component-based modular approach. All components are independently testable and deployable, free from monolithic stack dependencies.
