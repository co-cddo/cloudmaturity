### **Ad-Hoc and Independent Selections:** Each project independently selects technologies, leading to a diverse and often incompatible technology estate.

### **Uniform Technology Mandate:** Technology choices are highly regulated, with a uniform, organization-wide technology stack that all projects must adhere to.

### **Guided by Outdated Resources:** A technology radar and some documented patterns exist, but they are outdated and not widely regarded as useful or relevant.

### **Current and Maintained Guidance:** A regularly updated technology radar, along with current documentation and patterns, covers a wide range of use cases and is actively used for guidance.

### **Collaborative and Evolving Ecosystem:** Regular show-and-tell sessions and collaboration with existing teams are encouraged. There's a strong emphasis on reusing and extending existing solutions, alongside rewarding innovation and experimentation.
