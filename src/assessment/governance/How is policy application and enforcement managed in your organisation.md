### **No Policy Application:** Policies are not actively applied within the organisation.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

If policies are not actively applied, your organisation may still be at a very early or exploratory stage. You might perceive this as "good enough" if:

1. **No Critical or Sensitive Operations**

   - You operate minimal or non-critical services, handling little to no sensitive data or regulated workloads.
   - There’s no immediate requirement (audit, compliance, security) pressing for formal policy usage.

1. **Limited Scale or Temporary Projects**

   - Teams are small and can coordinate informally, or the entire environment is short-lived with minimal risk.

1. **No Internal or External Mandates**
   - No formal rules require compliance with recognised governance frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NCSC Cloud Security Principles).
   - Organisational leadership has not mandated policy implementation.

However, as soon as you store personal, official, or sensitive data—or your environment becomes critical to a public service—lack of policy application typically leads to risk of misconfigurations, data leaks, or compliance failures.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** steps to start applying policies:

1. **Define a Minimal Baseline Policy**

   - Begin by stating basic governance guidelines (e.g., "All user accounts must have multi-factor authentication," "All data must be encrypted at rest").
   - Publish this in a short doc or wiki, referencing relevant UK public sector best practices.

1. **Identify a Small Pilot Use Case**

   - Pick a single area (e.g., identity and access management) to apply a simple policy.
   - For instance:
     - [AWS: Use AWS IAM best practices or AWS Organizations for top-level policy control (Service Control Policies)](/TODO)
     - [Azure: Enable baseline Azure RBAC roles or Azure Policies to restrict certain resource creation](/TODO)
     - [GCP: Use Organization Policy to disallow public IPs for VMs, or enforce encryption keys usage](/TODO)
     - [OCI: Set basic compartment policies restricting resource creation or apply a minimal Security Zone policy](/TODO)
     - [IBM: Cloud IAM Best Practices](/TODO)

1. **Communicate the Policy**

   - Alert your team that from now on, they must follow this minimal policy.
   - Provide quick references or instructions in your Slack/Teams channel or an intranet page.

1. **Log Exceptions**
   - If someone must deviate from the baseline (e.g., a short-term test needing an exception), track it in a simple spreadsheet or ticket system.
   - This fosters accountability and sets the stage for incremental improvement.

By taking these initial steps—defining a baseline policy, piloting it, and communicating expectations—you move from "no policy application" toward a more controlled environment.

### **Policy Existence Without Enforcement:** Policies exist but are not actively enforced or monitored.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

Here, your organisation may have documented policies, but there is no real mechanism to ensure staff or systems comply. You might consider this "good enough" if:

1. **Policies Are Referenced, Not Mandatory**

   - Teams consult them occasionally but can ignore them with minimal consequences.
   - Leadership or audits haven’t flagged major non-compliance issues—yet.

1. **Low Regulatory Pressure**

   - You might not be heavily audited or regulated, so the absence of enforcement tools has not been problematic.

1. **Early in Maturity Journey**
   - You wrote policies to set direction, but formal enforcement mechanisms aren’t established. You rely on staff cooperation.

Over time, lack of enforcement typically leads to inconsistent implementation and potential security or compliance gaps. The risk escalates with more complex or critical workloads.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to start enforcing existing policies:

1. **Adopt Basic Monitoring or Reporting**

   - Use native cloud governance tools to see if resources match policy guidelines:
     - [AWS Config to track resource configurations vs. rules, e.g., "All S3 buckets must be private."](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_develop-rules_cfn-guard.html)
     - [Azure Policy to assess if VMs are using managed disks, or if TLS versions meet policy standards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview)
     - [GCP Organization Policy or Cloud Asset Inventory to detect resources violating your policy settings](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview)
     - [OCI Cloud Guard or Security Advisor for detecting non-compliant resources, e.g., public-facing services or unencrypted storage](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/CloudGuard/Concepts/cloudguard_overview.htm)

2. **Automate Alerts for Major Breaches**

   - If a policy states "No public buckets," set an alert that triggers if a bucket becomes public:
     - [AWS SNS or Amazon EventBridge to notify Slack or email on AWS Config rule violation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/notifications-for-AWS-Config.html)
     - [Azure Monitor alerts for Azure Policy non-compliant resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/how-to/get-compliance-data)
     - [GCP Cloud Monitoring + Pub/Sub triggers for Organization Policy or security anomalies](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/monitoring)
     - [OCI Event service + Notifications to detect and alert on security misconfigurations in compartments](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/FAQs/oci/Events-FAQ.pdf)

3. **Introduce Basic Consequence Management**

   - If a policy is violated, require the team to fill out an exception form or gain approval from a manager.
   - This ensures staff think twice before ignoring policy.

4. **Incrementally Expand Enforcement**
   - Start with "auditing mode," then gradually move to "deny mode." For example:
     - In AWS, use Service Control Policies or AWS Config rules in "detect-only" mode first, then enforce.
     - In Azure, run Azure Policy in "audit" effect, then shift to "deny" once comfortable.
     - GCP or OCI similarly allow rules to initially only log and then eventually block non-compliant actions.

By automating policy checks, alerting on critical breaches, and phasing in enforcement, you build momentum toward consistent compliance without overwhelming teams.

### **Process-Driven Application:** Policies are applied primarily through organisational processes without significant technical support.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

In this scenario, your organisation integrates policies into formal workflows (e.g., ticketing, approval boards, or documented SOPs), but relies on manual oversight rather than automated technical controls. It could be "good enough" if:

1. **Stable, Well-Understood Environments**

   - Your systems don’t change frequently, so manual approvals or reviews remain feasible.
   - The pace of service updates is relatively slow.

1. **Well-Trained Staff**

   - Teams consistently follow these processes, knowing policy steps are mandatory.
   - Leadership or compliance officers occasionally check random samples for compliance.

1. **Low Complexity**
   - A small number of applications or resources means manual reviews remain practical, and the risk of missing a violation is relatively low.

However, process-driven approaches can become slow and error-prone with scale or complexity. If you spin up ephemeral environments or adopt rapid CI/CD, purely manual processes might lag behind or fail to catch mistakes.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to enhance process-driven application:

1. **Introduce Lightweight Technical Automation**

   - Even if processes remain the backbone, add a few checks:
     - [AWS IAM Access Analyzer or AWS Config rules to highlight policy compliance before manual sign-off is given](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/validate-iam-policies-with-access-analyzer-using-aws-config-rules/)
     - [Azure DevOps Pipeline tasks that verify resource settings align with your documented policy before deployment completes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-policy-check-gate-v0?view=azure-pipelines)
     - [GCP Deployment Manager or Terraform with policy checks (e.g., TF OPA plugin) to confirm resources match your process-based policy steps](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation)
     - [OCI Resource Manager with custom pre-flight checks to ensure a requested resource meets policy criteria before final approval](https://blogs.oracle.com/ateam/post/automate-cis-compliance-checking)

1. **Use a Single Source of Truth**

   - Store policy documentation and forms in a single location (e.g., SharePoint, Confluence, or an internal Git repo).
   - This avoids confusion about which version of the process to follow.

1. **Add a "Policy Gate" to Ticketing Systems**

   - For example, in ServiceNow or Jira:
     - A ticket for provisioning a new VM or network must pass a "policy gate" status, requiring sign-off from a compliance or security person referencing your standard steps.

1. **Measure Process Efficiency**

   - Track how long it takes to apply each policy step. Identify bottlenecks or missed checks.
   - This helps you see where minimal automation or additional staff training could cut manual overhead.

1. **Conduct Periodic Spot Audits**
   - Check a random subset of completed tickets or new resources to ensure every policy step was genuinely followed, not just ticked off.
   - Publicise the outcomes so staff remain vigilant.

By introducing minor automation, centralising policy references, adding a policy gate in ticketing, and auditing process compliance, you blend the reliability of your current manual approach with the efficiency gains of technical enablers.

### **Process-Driven with Limited Technical Control:** Policies are comprehensively applied through processes, supported by limited technical control mechanisms.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this stage, your organisation uses well-defined processes to ensure policy compliance, supplemented by some technical controls (e.g., partial automation or read-only checks). You might consider it "good enough" if:

1. **Consistent, Repeatable Processes**

   - Your staff frequently comply with policy steps.
   - Automated checks (like scanning for open ports or misconfigurations) reduce human errors.

1. **Reduced Overheads**

   - Some tasks are automated, but you still rely on manual gating in certain high-risk or high-sensitivity areas.
   - This balance feels manageable for your scale and risk profile.

1. **Positive Audit Outcomes**
   - Internal or external audits indicate that your policy application is robust, with only minor improvements needed.

However, if you want to handle larger workloads or adopt faster continuous delivery, you might need more comprehensive technical enforcement that eliminates many manual steps and further reduces the chance of oversight.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** ways to reinforce or extend your existing setup:

1. **Expand Technical Enforcement**

   - Implement more "deny by default" mechanisms:
     - [AWS Service Control Policies or AWS Organizations guardrails to block unauthorized resource actions globally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html)
     - [Azure Policy in "Deny" mode for known non-compliant resource configurations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/effect-deny)
     - [GCP Organization Policy with hard constraints, e.g., disallow external IP addresses on VMs if policy forbids them](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview)
     - [OCI Security Zones or integrated IAM policies that automatically reject certain resource settings](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm)

1. **Integrate Observability and Alerting**

   - Use real-time or near-real-time monitoring to detect policy breaches quickly:
     - [AWS CloudWatch or Amazon EventBridge triggers for changes that violate policy rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Acting_Alarm_Changes.html)
     - [Azure Monitor alerts on policy compliance drifts or suspicious activities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview)
     - [GCP Security Command Center notifications for flagged policy violations in near real time](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/notifications)
     - [OCI Cloud Guard alerting on anomalies or known policy contraventions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/CloudGuard/Concepts/cloudguard_overview.htm)

1. **Adopt "Immutability" or "Infrastructure as Code"**

   - If possible, define infrastructure states in code. Your policy steps can be embedded:
     - [AWS CloudFormation with StackSets and AWS Config to align with known "gold" standards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-cloudformation.html)
     - [Azure Resource Manager (Bicep) or Terraform that references Azure Policies in code, ensuring compliance from the start](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/comparing-terraform-and-bicep)
     - [GCP Terraform with policy constraints integrated, automatically validated at plan time](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation)
     - [OCI Resource Manager stacks that validate resource definitions against your policies before applying changes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/stacksoverview.htm)

1. **Push for More Cross-Team Training**

   - Ensure DevOps, security, and compliance teams understand how to interpret automated policy checks.
   - This fosters a shared sense of ownership and makes the half-automated approach more effective.

1. **Set Up a Policy Remediation or "Self-Healing" Mechanism**
   - Where feasible, let your system automatically fix minor compliance drifts:
     - e.g., If a bucket is created public by mistake, the system reverts it to private and notifies the user.

By strengthening technical guardrails, improving alerting, and embedding your policies deeper into IaC, you evolve your limited technical controls into a more comprehensive and proactive enforcement model.

### **Fully Integrated Application and Enforcement:** Policies are applied and enforced comprehensively through well-established processes, with robust technical controls executed at all stages.

#### **How to determine if this good enough**

At this final stage, policy application is deeply woven into both organisational processes and automated technical controls:

1. **End-to-End Enforcement**

   - Every step of resource creation, modification, or retirement is governed by your policy—there’s no easy workaround or manual override without documented approval.

1. **High Automation, High Reliability**

   - The majority of policy compliance checks and remediation are automated. Staff rarely need to intervene except for unusual exceptions.

1. **Predictable Governance**

   - Audits or compliance reviews are smooth. Minimal policy violations occur, and if they do, they’re swiftly detected and addressed.

1. **Alignment with Public Sector Standards**
   - You likely meet or exceed typical security or compliance frameworks, easily demonstrating robust controls to oversight bodies.

Even at this apex, continuous improvement remains relevant. Evolving technology or new departmental mandates might require ongoing updates to maintain best-in-class enforcement.

#### **How to do better**

Below are **rapidly actionable** refinements, even at the highest maturity:

1. **Adopt Policy-as-Code with Automated Testing**

   - Store policy definitions in version control, run them through pipeline tests:
     - [AWS: Service Control Policies or AWS Config rules in Git, tested with custom scripts or frameworks like OPA (Open Policy Agent)](https://github.com/aws-samples/service-control-policy-examples)
     - [Azure: Policies, RBAC templates in a Git repo, validated with Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions before rollout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/manage-azure-policy)
     - [GCP: Organization Policy or Terraform policies tested in a staging environment with OPA or Terraform Validator pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation)
     - [OCI: Policy definitions or Security Zones config in code, automatically tested with custom scripts or OPA-based solutions before applying to production](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm)

1. **Enable Dynamic, Real-Time Adjustments**

   - Some advanced organisations adopt "adaptive policies" that can respond automatically to shifting risk contexts:
     - e.g., Requiring step-up authentication or extra scanning if abnormal usage patterns appear.

1. **Analytics and Reporting on Policy Efficacy**

   - Track metrics like "time to resolve policy violations," "number of exceptions requested per quarter," or "percentage of resources in compliance."
   - Present these metrics to leadership for data-driven improvements.

1. **Cross-department Collaboration**

   - If you share data or resources with other public sector agencies, coordinate policy definitions or enforcement bridging solutions.
   - This ensures consistent governance and security across multi-department projects.

1. **Regularly Test Failover or Incident Response**
   - Conduct simulation exercises to confirm that policy enforcement remains intact during partial outages or security incidents.
   - Evaluate whether the automated controls effectively protect resources and whether manual overrides are restricted or well-logged.

By implementing policy-as-code with automated testing, adopting dynamic enforcement, collecting analytics on compliance, and performing cross-department or incident drills, you ensure your integrated model remains agile and robust—setting a high benchmark for public sector governance.

**Keep doing what you’re doing,** and consider writing internal blog posts or external case studies about your policy enforcement journey. Submit pull requests to this guidance or related public sector best-practice repositories so others can learn from your advanced application and enforcement strategies.
