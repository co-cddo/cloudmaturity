### **No Policy Application:** Policies are not actively applied within the organization.

### **Policy Existence Without Enforcement:** Policies exist but are not actively enforced or monitored.

### **Process-Driven Application:** Policies are applied primarily through organizational processes without significant technical support.

### **Process-Driven with Limited Technical Control:** Policies are comprehensively applied through processes, supported by limited technical control mechanisms.

### **Fully Integrated Application and Enforcement:** Policies are applied and enforced comprehensively through well-established processes, with robust technical controls executed at all stages.
