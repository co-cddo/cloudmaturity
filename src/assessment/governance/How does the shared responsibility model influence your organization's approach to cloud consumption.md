### **Minimal Consideration of Shared Responsibility:** The shared responsibility model is not a primary factor in cloud consumption decisions, often leading to misunderstandings or gaps in responsibility.

### **Basic Awareness of Shared Responsibilities:** There is a basic understanding of the model, but it's not systematically applied or deeply understood across the organization.

### **Informed Decision-Making Based on Shared Responsibilities:** Decisions regarding cloud consumption are informed by the shared responsibility model, ensuring a clearer understanding of the division of responsibilities.

### **Strategic Integration of Shared Responsibility in Cloud Planning:** The shared responsibility model is strategically integrated into cloud consumption planning, with regular assessments to ensure responsibilities are well-managed. Decisions to retain responsibilities in house are documented and shared with the cloud vendor.

### **Critical Factor in Cloud Consumption and Value Assessment:** The shared responsibility model is central to all decision-making regarding cloud consumption. It's regularly revisited to assess value for money and optimize the division of responsibilities with the cloud vendor.
