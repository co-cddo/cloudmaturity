### **Manual or Imperative Provisioning:** Cloud services are primarily provisioned manually through consoles, portals, CLI, or other tools, without significant automation.

### **Limited Scripting with No Standards:** Provisioning involves some scripting, but there are no formal standards or consistency across project teams.

### **Partial Declarative Automation:** Declarative automation is used for provisioning some cloud services across their lifecycle, but this practice is not uniform across all teams.

### **Widespread Use of Declarative Automation:** Most project teams employ declarative automation for cloud service provisioning, indicating a higher level of maturity in automation practices.

### **Mandatory Declarative Automation via CI/CD:** Declarative automation is mandated for provisioning all production services, and it is exclusively executed through Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
