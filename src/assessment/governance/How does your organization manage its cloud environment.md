### **Manual Click-Ops as Required:** Cloud management is performed manually as and when needed, without any systematic approach or automation.

### **Documented Manual Click-Ops:** Manual click-ops are used, but steps are documented. Operations may be tested in a similarly maintained non-production environment, though discrepancies likely exist between environments.

### **Semi-Automated with Some Scripting:** Some aspects of cloud management are automated, possibly through scripting, but manual interventions are still common for complex tasks or configurations.

### **Highly Automated with Standardized Processes:** Cloud management is largely automated with standardized processes across environments. Regular reviews and updates are made to ensure alignment with best practices.

### **Fully Managed by Declarative Code with Drift Detection:** Cloud management is fully automated and managed by declarative code. Continual automated drift detection is in place, with alerts for any deviations treated as significant incidents.
