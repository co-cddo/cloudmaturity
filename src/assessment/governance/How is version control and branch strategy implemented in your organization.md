### **Limited Version Control Usage:** Version control is used minimally, indicating a lack of robust processes for managing code changes and history.

### **Custom, Unconventional Branch Strategy:** An invented branch strategy is in use, not aligning with standard methodologies and potentially leading to confusion or inefficiencies.

### **Adapted Recognized Branch Strategy:** The organization adapts a recognized branch strategy (like GitFlow or GitHubFlow), tailoring it to specific needs while maintaining some standard practices.

### **Textbook Implementation of a recognized branch strategy:** The organization adheres strictly to a model such as GitFlow, a recognized branch strategy suitable for managing complex development processes.

### **Textbook Implementation of a streamlined branch strategy:** The organization follows a streamlined branch strategy ideal for continuous delivery and simplified collaboration such as GitHubFlow precisely.
