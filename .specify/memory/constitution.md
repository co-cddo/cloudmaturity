# Cloud Maturity Model Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centered Design

The tool MUST prioritize user needs above technical convenience. Features SHALL be designed to provide actionable, targeted guidance rather than generic advice. Every question and answer MUST help users understand their current state and provide explicit next steps. The tool is NOT an assurance or data collection mechanism—it exists solely to help organizations improve.

**Rationale**: Organizations using this tool need practical help, not bureaucratic assessment. User-centered design ensures the guidance remains relevant and actionable.

### II. Accessibility First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All features MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards as a minimum. This includes semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast. Accessibility MUST be tested during development, not retrofitted. No feature ships without passing accessibility validation.

**Rationale**: As a government tool, accessibility is both a legal requirement and a moral obligation. Excluding users with disabilities contradicts the tool's purpose of providing inclusive guidance.

### III. Test-Driven Development

Tests MUST be written before implementation. For each feature: (1) write tests, (2) verify tests fail, (3) implement feature, (4) verify tests pass. Integration tests MUST cover user journeys. Unit tests MUST cover business logic and validation. No pull request merges without passing tests.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures correctness, prevents regression, and documents expected behavior. For a guidance tool, incorrect advice is worse than no advice.

### IV. Simplicity & Maintainability

Code MUST be simple and maintainable. Avoid premature optimization. Prefer established patterns over novel solutions. Dependencies MUST be justified—fewer is better. Documentation MUST explain "why" decisions were made, not just "what" the code does.

**Rationale**: This project relies on open-source contributions. Complex code creates barriers to entry and increases maintenance burden. Simple code invites participation.

### V. Security & Open Standards

Security MUST be built in, not bolted on. Dependencies MUST be kept current. All inputs MUST be validated. Secrets MUST NOT be committed to version control. The tool MUST follow open standards (OpenAPI, JSON Schema) to enable interoperability and transparency.

**Rationale**: Government tools handle sensitive organizational information. Security failures erode trust. Open standards ensure longevity and reduce vendor lock-in.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- Code MUST pass linting (Prettier) before commit
- Pull requests MUST be reviewed by at least one maintainer
- Commit messages MUST follow conventional commit format
- Breaking changes MUST be documented in CHANGELOG.md

### Testing Requirements

- Unit test coverage MUST exceed 80%
- Integration tests MUST cover all user-facing workflows
- Accessibility tests MUST be automated where possible
- Performance tests MUST validate page load times <3s

### Documentation

- New features MUST include user-facing documentation
- API changes MUST update OpenAPI specifications
- Contribution guidelines MUST be kept current
- Code comments MUST explain complex business logic

## Security & Compliance

### Dependency Management

- Dependencies MUST be reviewed before addition
- Automated security scanning (CodeQL, Dependabot) MUST be enabled
- Security vulnerabilities MUST be patched within 30 days of disclosure
- Deprecated dependencies MUST be upgraded or replaced

### Data Protection

- User assessment data MUST NOT be transmitted to external servers
- Local storage MUST be used for saving assessment progress
- No personal data collection without explicit user consent
- Privacy policy MUST be clear and accessible

### OpenSSF Compliance

- Project MUST maintain OpenSSF Best Practices badge
- All releases MUST be signed and verified
- Security policy MUST define responsible disclosure process
- Harden-runner MUST be enabled for GitHub Actions

## Governance

### Amendment Process

Constitutional amendments require:

1. Proposal documented in GitHub issue with rationale
2. Community discussion period (minimum 7 days)
3. Approval from project maintainers (majority vote)
4. Version bump following semantic versioning rules
5. Migration plan for affected code and documentation
6. Update to all dependent templates and documentation

### Versioning Policy

Constitution uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes (principle removal/redefinition)
- **MINOR**: New principles or material expansions
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

- All pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance
- Feature specifications MUST document principle adherence
- Implementation plans MUST include constitution check gates
- Quarterly reviews MUST assess if constitution remains fit for purpose

### Conflict Resolution

When this constitution conflicts with other project documentation:

1. Constitution takes precedence
2. Conflicting documentation MUST be updated
3. If constitution is wrong, follow amendment process
4. Document resolution in PR and constitution change log
